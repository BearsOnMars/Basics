within a few years after the end of the Second World War, political life in these countries underwent an unprecedented revision. By the 1960s, the old Protestant nationalism that had animated the generation of Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower had been set aside, and Enlightenment liberalism became the new framework within which American political life was conducted.

a new liberal constitution that guaranteed the civil liberties of blacks and other minorities, but also banned prayer and Bible-reading from the schools and lifted earlier legal restrictions on divorce, pornography, immigration, and abortion. Academics and intellectuals even gave a new name to the regime—which they now called “liberal democracy.”1 In the decades that followed, many Americans and Europeans came to believe that in liberalism, they had discovered the final political theory: a regime so obviously desirable that competition among political ideologies had in effect come to an end.

the great majority of nationalist conservatives who supported the Trump presidency. To be sure, their insistence on the centrality of the nation in political life means that they oppose many aspects of the liberal consensus of recent decades—including large-scale immigration; the offshoring of American manufacturing capabilities to China in the name of free trade; the empowerment of international bodies such as the UN, EU, and WTO at the expense of independent national states; and wars aimed at bringing liberalism to the Middle East. They propose government action against the progressive cartels that dominate big business, the media, universities, and schools, and they seek policy changes that may assist in reversing the dissolution of the family and the decline of religious tradition. But nationalist conservatives support a democratic regime and peaceful transitions of power, as well as customary Anglo-American protections for property rights, freedom of speech, and free exercise of religion. These characteristics make national conservatism a powerful force with great potential for political revival and restoration in the coming years, whether on its own or in alliance with anti-Marxist liberals. In fact, with the collapse of liberal hegemony in America, nationalist conservatism offers the best hope for restoration of political stability and health.

An important principle of Anglo-American conservative thought is this: When faced with the disastrous consequences of a particular course of action, we must retrace our steps and restore, as much as possible, the conditions that existed prior to setting out on this course. This is what happened in 1660, when Matthew Hale proposed the restoration of the English monarchy.

Anglo-American conservatism has long placed the idea of the nation—at first the English nation, and later the British and American nations—at the center of political life. But the “nationalist” aspect of Anglo-American conservatism does become more pronounced during periods when the integrity of the nation is directly challenged by an excessive internationalism, localism, or individualism. This was the case, for example, when England was threatened with absorption into the Spanish Empire in the 1580s, when the Americans sought to establish themselves as a single independent nation in the 1780s, and with the rise of internationalist utopianism in the 1910s. In the same way, the conservative movement in America and Britain after the mid-2010s is rightly called a “nationalist” conservatism, since it seeks to return the national interest, or the common good of the nation, to the center of political discourse, after decades in which the freedom of the individual became the overriding principle in all spheres of

liberal dogma offers a very different view from that of, for instance, the Hebrew Bible. Whereas Hebrew Scripture depicts human reason as weak, capable only of local knowledge, and generally unreliable, liberalism depicts human reason as exceedingly powerful, capable of universal knowledge, and accessible to anyone who will but consult it. Similarly, whereas the Bible depicts moral and political obligation as deriving from God and inherited by way of family, national, and religious tradition, liberalism makes no mention of either God or inherited tradition, much less the specific institutions that permit its transmission across generations.

Liberalism is a substantive belief system that provides an alternative foundation for our views concerning the nature of human beings, reason, and the sources of the moral obligations that bind us. This alternative foundation has not coexisted with earlier political tradition, rooted in the Bible, as we were told it would. It has rather cut this earlier tradition to ribbons. For example, the liberal belief that reason is powerful, universal, and reliable has meant that there is, in principle, no need to consult national and religious tradition, or even to accord such traditions honor and respect. Private individuals can toy with such things if they so choose. But public life, we have been led to suppose, can be conducted perfectly well without them. Similarly, the belief that political obligation derives only from the consent of the reasoning individual has meant that political and religious tradition has, in principle, no weight at all, or at least no weight that can be admitted as legitimate.

the truth is that neither the U.S. Constitution nor the principal constitutional documents in Britain explicitly endorse liberal doctrines, and so it must be admitted that these documents are not the source of the troubles these nations are facing today. A conservative democracy would, however, reject the axioms of the liberal-rationalist system to which American and European elites have been dogmatically committed since the 1960s. It would instead be concerned to maintain a sustainable balance between the principles of limited government and individual liberties (Principles 4 and 5) on the one hand, and the principles of religion, nationalism, and historical empiricism (Principles 1, 2, and 3) on the other.

Since Enlightenment liberalism is the source of the current catastrophe, biblical tradition—Christianity and Judaism—must be recovered as the normative framework and standard determining public life wherever a majority of the public is wise enough to adopt this course. The key to such a restoration would be overturning the postwar Supreme Court decisions that imposed the principle of “separation of church and state” in America. More than anything else, these sweeping decisions delegitimized Christianity as the basis for public life in America and other Western countries, and initiated the ongoing cultural revolution with which we are familiar. Even the Reagan coalition of the 1980s, which embraced orthodox Christians and Jews and spoke explicitly of the return of religion to the public arena, was unable to slow the progress of this revolution. But now we have come to the end of the road. We have seen the grotesque finale in which the children of Enlightenment rationalism demolish the liberal society that was established by their grandparents

The trauma of the Second World War persuaded Americans and Europeans to adopt the closed system of Enlightenment-liberal principles as the sole foundation for public life and moral obligation. But Enlightenment liberalism provides no resources for maintaining the traditional forms of public life and moral obligation that these nations had previously known. Christian and Jewish religion, the independent national state, the traditional family and congregation, and even the distinction between man and woman—all of these things have their basis in the Bible.

The place that India has long occupied in global thinking is manifest in the obsessive search for trade routes to it. They may have initially taken European explorers to the American continent. But when the explorers finally reached India by sea, even more significant consequences unfolded. Using it as an effective base, Europe was able to thereafter dominate the rest of Asia. In fact, even China’s fate in the nineteenth century was very much shaped by the outcomes in India. Not surprisingly, this centrality of India worked the other way around as well. Its independence set in motion a larger decolonization process that became the basis for the contemporary global order. Decades later, India’s economic progress contributes to a rebalancing and multipolarity that is still unfolding.

In knowledge work, when you agree to a new commitment, be it a minor task or a large project, it brings with it a certain amount of ongoing administrative overhead: back-and-forth email threads needed to gather information, for example, or meetings scheduled to synchronize with your collaborators. This overhead tax activates as soon as you take on a new responsibility. As your to-do list grows, so does the total amount of overhead tax you’re paying. Because the number of hours in the day is fixed, these administrative chores will take more and more time away from your core work, slowing down the rate at which these objectives are accomplished.

The world has moved on from the days when small groups of professionals (major news organizations, medical associations, scientific academies, etc.), networked by messengers, mail, and telephone, digested the world’s scarce data to give the rest of us the answers we need for for our daily decision-making. Perhaps the signature difference characterizing the Third Millennium is that now we are all “in the game,” all networked, like it or not. With all of our direct access to vast universes of data, we are now forced to figure out what facts to base our decisions on, when to do research for ourselves and when to look for experts, what experts are trustworthy (and on which particular topics), and when we might need wise guidance on integrating values.

To make a sound decision, take a meaningful action, or solve a problem — whether as individuals, in groups, or as a society — we need first to understand reality. But when reality is not easy to discern, and we’re not sure which experts to trust to clarify the matter, we adopt other strategies for navigating the clutter. We “go with our gut”; decide what we “believe” and look for evidence to reaffirm whatever that is; adopt positions based on our affiliations with people we know; even find reassurance in belittling the people who disagree with us. We choose to consult experts who tell us what we like to hear; or bond in shared mistrust of people providing or communicating the information that confuses us, whether they are scientists, scholars, journalists, community leaders, policymakers, or other experts. These coping strategies may help us get by in our personal or professional lives; they may provide a consoling sense of identity or belonging. But they do not actually help us see clearly or make good decisions. And resorting to them can have dangerous social and political consequences.

The active position of the list, by contrast, should be limited to three projects at most. When scheduling your time, you should focus your attention only on the projects on your active list. When you complete one of these projects, you can remove it from your list. This leaves open a free slot that you can fill by pulling in a new project from the holding tank. For larger projects, you might want to instead pull onto your active list a reasonable chunk of work toward its completion.

You should update and clean your lists once a week. In addition to pulling in new work to fill empty slots on your active list, you should also review upcoming deadlines. Prioritize what’s due soon, and send updates for any work that you know you’re not going to finish by the time promised. These cleaning sessions also provide a good opportunity to remove from your holding tank projects that are languishing. If you’ve delayed the same project again and again, for example, this might be a good sign that you’re not really equipped to handle it, or that it falls outside your comfort zone.

the managerial class didn’t know how to handle the autonomy and variety of jobs in this new sector. Their stopgap response was pseudo-productivity, which used visible activity as a proxy for usefulness. Under this new configuration, we took another step backward. As in the industrial sector, we continued to work all day, every day, without seasonal changes, as any such variation would now be received as nonproductiveness. But unlike in the industrial sector, in this invisible factory we’d constructed for ourselves we didn’t have reform legislation or unions to identify the most draining aspects of this setup and fight for limits. Knowledge work was free to totalize our existence: colonizing as much of our time, from evenings to weekends to vacations, as we could bear, and leaving little recourse beyond burnout or demotion or quitting when it became too much. Our estrangement from the rhythms of work that dominated the first two hundred eighty thousand years of our species’ existence was now complete.

Working with unceasing intensity is artificial and unsustainable. In the moment, it might exude a false sense of usefulness, but when continued over time, it estranges us from our fundamental nature, generates misery, and, from a strictly economic perspective, almost certainly holds us back from reaching our full capabilities. A more natural, slower, varied pace to work is the foundation of true productivity in the long term.

Most people restrict their long-term planning to cover something like the next few months. You might have a goal, for example, to write and submit an academic paper by the end of the fall, or introduce a new product over the summer. Planning at this scale is certainly necessary, as without it you might end up mired in shallow demands and never really move forward on anything important. I suggest, however, also crafting a plan that covers an even larger scale: what you would like to accomplish in the next five years or so. The specific choice of five years is somewhat arbitrary. You can adjust this quantity to fit the reality of your situation: if you’ve just started a four-year degree program, for example, a four-year plan might make more sense. The key to this suggestion, however, is that your time horizon should include at least several years.

If you’re too ambitious, your intensity will remain pegged at a high level as you scramble to try to hit your targets. If you instead give yourself more than enough time to accomplish your objectives, the pace of your work can fall into a more natural groove. A simple heuristic to achieve this latter state is the following: take whatever timelines you first identify as reasonable for upcoming projects, and then double their length.

One of the central joys of slowing down your work pace is that it frees you from needing to attack every day with frantic intensity. To reap this benefit, however, you actually have to simplify your daily schedule. Toning down your seasonal and long-term plans won’t help if you persist in filling every hour of the current day with more work than you can hope to complete. All three timescales must be tamed together. To create more reasonable workdays, I have two suggestions: first, reduce the number of tasks you schedule, and second, reduce the number of appointments on your calendar. In other words, cut back on what you plan to accomplish while increasing your available time.

Older households have had years to accumulate home furnishings and wardrobes full of clothing, and they are often disinclined to acquire more; vacation trips, restaurant meals, and medical bills are likely to figure larger in their spending than furniture and fixtures.

Another factor suppressing demand for physical products is the transformation of goods into services. The multipiece stereo systems that graced every student’s bedroom at the start of the Third Globalization, with racks of plastic cases filled with compact discs close by, gave way in the early 2000s to computers that featured internal disc drives for data storage and optical drives to play CDs; those vanished in turn in the 2010s as both data storage and content came to be provided over the internet, via servers that are used far more intensively than the average personal computer. Culture is arguably more global than ever before, but digital downloads and streaming services have made it possible to enjoy films, books, and music without physically possessing the sorts of goods once sold in book and record stores.

Businesses, too, don’t spend like they used to. Once, business investment meant purchases of hard assets such as buildings and machinery, creating demand for factory products like bulldozers and production equipment. By the 2010s, though, more than one-fifth of business investment in many countries went into research, software, and other nonphysical expenditures, two or three times the share of the late 1980s. The outsourcing of information technology—and particularly the storage of data in “cloud” computer banks managed by technology companies and accessible over the internet rather than in computers located in-house—has held down spending on computer equipment, one of the most globalized of products.

Technology has enabled manufacturers to devote far less attention to molding, extruding, stamping, and assembling physical products and far more to services related to the goods they sell: clever engineering, creative marketing, and after-sales repair and maintenance offer better returns on investment and higher obstacles to potential competitors than running assembly lines.

EVs do not have engines, transmissions, or emissions-control equipment, so as they gain market share, there will be less need for workers to produce gears and piston rings—and less reason to farm production out to low-wage countries. Robots, initially used in factories to perform tasks too uncomfortable or dangerous for humans, have become sophisticated enough to mass-produce T-shirts, a development that could make it feasible for high-wage countries to be competitive in making some types of clothing.

Even with generous subsidies for manufacturers, shipbuilders, and ocean carriers, the perception that long value chains have become costlier, riskier, less reliable, and less essential was bringing an end to the globalization of the early twenty-first century well before the coronavirus arrived on the scene. Regardless of what actions governments take, goods trade is likely to grow more slowly than the world economy in the years ahead, and may soon start to decline. Is globalization over? Not by any stretch. Rather, it has entered a new stage. While globalization is retreating with respect to factory production and foreign investment, it is advancing quickly when it comes to the flow of services and ideas. The vision of the Third Globalization was that engineers and designers working for large corporations in the advanced economies would create products to be manufactured in places where wages were lower, which those corporations could then sell around the world. In the Fourth Globalization, it is the research, engineering, and design work that is being globalized: the hundred largest companies accounted for more than one-third of all business research and development spending worldwide, often distributing it among technical centers in multiple countries in order to take advantage of local talent and to shape products to local tastes. The manufacturing, meanwhile, can be done almost anywhere. The diminished role of physical production is reflected in the tendency of industrial companies to structure their foreign involvements through licensing arrangements with local firms and contracts with suppliers of manufacturing services, rather than by investing their shareholders’ money and hiring their own production employees abroad—one reason for the decline in foreign direct investment. Workers with the requisite technical training can look forward to opportunities in highly automated factories, even in places where wages are high.

For generations, the real wage rate in the US had grown at more or less the same rate as output per hour of work. This meant that their ratio, the share of output paid out in wages and salaries, had no trend. There were short-run variations but not much else. That seems to have changed in late 1960s or early 1970s. The real wage trend began to fall short of the productivity trend. It was not that the productivity trend accelerated; that might suggest something technological going on. The difference was that real wages fell behind.

During the first seventy years or so of the twentieth century, American capitalism pretty regularly delivered about three-fourths of the national income in the form of wages and salaries. That is the trendless number I mentioned earlier. During the past forty years or so that number began to diminish, and it had reached something like two-thirds when the pandemic arrived. That is still much the larger part of national income.

For most US workers, the trajectory of productivity growth diverged from the trajectory of wage growth four decades ago. This decoupling had baleful economic and social consequences: low-paid, insecure jobs held by non-college-educated workers; low participation rates in the labor force; weak upward mobility across generations; and festering racial earnings and employment disparities that have not substantially improved in decades.

history and economics show no intrinsic conflict among technological change, full employment, and rising earnings. The dynamic interplay among task automation, innovation, and new work creation, while always disruptive, is a primary wellspring of rising productivity. Innovation improves the quantity, quality, and variety of work that a worker can accomplish in a given time. This rising productivity, in turn, enables improving living standards and the flourishing of human endeavors. Indeed, in what should be a virtuous cycle, rising productivity provides society with the resources to invest

When innovation fails to drive opportunity, however, it generates a fear of the future: the suspicion that technological progress will make the country wealthier while threatening numerous livelihoods. This fear exacts a high price: political and regional divisions, distrust of institutions, and mistrust of innovation itself. This anxiety has been laid bare in US politics as a growing gulf between the “haves” and the “have-nots” has driven a deepening national schism over how society should respond to the needs of those at the bottom of the economic ladder.

This book suggests a better alternative: building a future of work that harvests the dividends of rapidly advancing automation and ever more powerful computers to deliver opportunity and economic security for workers. To do that, we must foster institutional innovations that complement technological change.

Work is a crucial human good. “Not simply a source of income,” Task Force Research Advisory Board member Josh Cohen writes in an MIT Work of the Future research brief, “work is a way that we can learn, exercise our powers of perception, imagination, and judgment, collaborate socially, and make constructive social contributions.”1 Even when work is solely a means of acquiring an income, it should offer a sense of purpose and not require submission to demeaning or arbitrary authority, unhealthy or unsafe conditions, or physical or mental degradation.

in the mid-1970s, when India was staggering under the burden of a homespun socialism heavily influenced by the Soviet Union. The government had nationalized any business that was big, thrown out many that were foreign, and started building a welfare state—before generating the revenue to pay for it. Shortages were routine; the economy grew at a painfully slow rate. Per capita income was falling behind the global average.

East Asian nations like South Korea and Taiwan were, like Singapore, giving people far greater economic freedom and were seeing fast gains in income, alongside rapid declines in poverty and infant mortality. China was leaving India behind. In 1990, the two had similar average incomes: since then, China’s has risen fortyfold to $12,500, while India’s rose just sevenfold to $2,400. To this day the standard Indian excuse is that the world’s largest democracy can’t force march development the way Communist China once did. But democracy is not the problem; many democracies have grown much richer than India. It is India’s lingering attachment to a state that overpromises and under-delivers.

India’s critical mistakes included doing too little to expand economic freedom, and too much to build a welfare state, too soon. The government didn’t spend more heavily than its Asian rivals, but it did spend less wisely, having introduced free social programs at a much earlier stage of development, before building the roads and schools that could generate incomes high enough to pay for those programs. The imperious Indian state was quick to regulate, officiate, and pick winners, overconfident that its priorities were correct.

Too often, Indian politicians sell aid to select businesses or industries as economic reform, when the measures in fact retard competition and growth. Pro-business is not the same as pro-capitalism, and the distinction continues to elude us. The result: despite all of India’s inherent strengths, from a strong entrepreneurial culture to world-class human capital, it will take longer to become a developed nation than it could have. In pursuit of the unreachable socialist ideal—equality of outcomes—India long denied itself the very real promise of capitalism: equality of opportunity.

Political and popular support for a larger state is higher now than it has been in at least half a century. Republicans are campaigning against Biden more on social issues than on his willingness to wield state power, since they are in many cases equally willing to impose government control on flows of people, money, or goods. Like populists on the left, many of those on the right share a sense that decades of free market ideology are behind today’s economic ills. This increasingly bipartisan and conventional wisdom is, I think, based on a fundamental misreading of economic history. Flaws that economists blame on “market failures,” including inequality and inordinate corporate power, often flow more from government excesses. In particular, constant government support and intervention in financial markets has crippled the competition that would break up concentrations of personal and corporate power, were capitalism allowed to function properly.

The United States has had an astonishing run in the last four decades, losing nothing of its 25 percent share of the global economy over that time, while China was expanding its share rapidly—and entirely at the expense of Europe and Japan. As a financial superpower, the United States remains as strong as ever, the dollar by far the dominant currency in global trade, the U.S. stock and bond markets bigger than ever, relative to the rest of the world.

Contrary to the narrative that prevails today, Reagan did not “reverse the course of government.” The welfare state, the regulatory state, the national security state, all held steady or continued to grow, and government deepened its influence on our economic lives. What changed, starting in the late seventies and accelerating under Reagan, was the way government pays for itself—by borrowing to cover the perennial deficit. Four decades later capitalism is addicted to debt.

When capitalism is working, it gives people freedom to vote in the marketplace, by investing in new ideas and growing companies. Their choices determine prices, and those prices reflect the public’s best bet on which ideas and companies are poised to thrive in the future. The collective wisdom of millions of individuals, scrutinizing every deal closely, cannot be matched by the lone mind of the state, trying to steer capital from on high. Capitalism is the economic soulmate of democracy, equally fair and flawed. With the partial exception of tiny Singapore, no wealthy, developed economy is not a fully formed democracy. And no centralized autocracy has ever grown rich in the modern era. China may never make it into the developed class, in part because it is in the process of bringing back big government.

Today governments watch for jitters in the markets and rush in to support them with easy money and bailouts at the first sign of trouble. When government becomes the dominant buyer and seller in the market—as it has in recent decades—it distorts the price signals that normally guide capital. Money starts to flow down the paths of least regulatory resistance, or most government support.

In the Sanders view, the story begins with leaders like Reagan shrinking government. Over the next four decades they gutted regulations, which left rich capitalists free to run wild, and downsized the welfare state, which left the poor to get poorer. Sanders always pairs his critique of “socialism for the very rich” with “rugged individualism for the poor.” The problem is a shrinking government, he says, so the answer must be more regulation and welfare spending—a view that captivates many Americans, especially the young.

Government had been growing steadily since the 1930s, and during the pandemic matched peaks of spending and debt reached in World War II. Capitalism has been twisted into an unfair and inefficient form, but not mainly by rules stacked in favor of big companies and tycoons. It has been distorted above all by governments and central banks pumping more money into the economy than the markets can possibly invest effectively. More than just socialism for the very rich, the underlying issue is socialized risk for everyone—the government extending the safety net beyond the poor to the middle class and the rich, at a pace and scale that have corrupted capitalism with debt. Bigger government will only magnify the distortions.

The “neoliberal turn” was very real, but it was, for the most part, a turn of the mind. The neoliberals resurrected the ideas of classic liberal thinkers like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, who were the original apostles of small government and free market capitalism. The neos rejected the way the word “liberal” had been repurposed, starting in the New Deal and continuing through Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society in the 1960s, to describe people in favor of a larger welfare state. Starting in the fifties, the neoliberals had been plotting to overthrow the New Deal and much that followed. Clustered around economists and political scientists at the University of Chicago, they developed the agenda of cutting—taxes, spending, and regulation—that Reagan brought to the White House in 1980. In practice, however, neoliberalism did not slow the momentum of big government. There was some slowdown at least in spending under Reagan, even a brief and isolated retreat under Bill Clinton in the 1990s, but not to the degree talk of new ages and orders implies. After 2000, government was booming again.

There was an era of small government, but it ended in the United States with the Depression. Washington circa 1930, before FDR was first elected to the White House, would be entirely unrecognizable today. Half the government departments had yet to be created, and those that did exist were a sliver of what they would become. Half of all federal government employees worked for the post office. The Capitol, the citadel of democracy, would soon be dwarfed in scale by the temples of New Deal bureaucracy, first the headquarters of the Commerce Department and then in 1936 of the Agriculture Department—the world’s largest office building at the time. Income taxes, introduced in 1913, were still relatively light, so Washington raised revenue largely through tariffs and tolls. Federal government spending was so low, less than 4 percent of GDP, even a large deficit would not have had much impact on the economy. Deficits were not only rare, they were a breach of the prevailing post-Victorian ethos, which saw debt as a moral failing and bankruptcy as a criminal offense. Compared to the capitals of Europe, Washington was like a small company town.

Since the 1930s, public spending has grown steadily as a share of every large capitalist economy, punctuated by two upward spikes during World War II and the pandemic of 2020. There was never a sustained retreat anywhere in the leading capitalist economies, which I’ll call the LCEs. Owing to limited historical data for others, I include in this group the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the four major members of the European Union: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. Since 1930, spending by government—including state and local—has quadrupled on average to 48 percent of GDP in the LCEs, but within a broad range, rising from 4 percent to 36 percent in the United States and from 19 percent to 58 percent in France.

the regulatory state grew dramatically—more rules, more restrictive rules, more rule-makers, and more rule-making agencies with bigger budgets. The legislators cut some taxes, raised others, and overall the government’s tax take didn’t change much. “Hauser’s law,” really just a factual observation, states that while the sources of tax revenue shift constantly, the total tax burden hasn’t changed for decades. Including state and local government, it has hovered slightly above 20 percent of GDP on average in the LCEs, and slightly under 20 percent in the United States. If revenues are so steady over time, how can it be that government is growing more expansive? The big change was that the large capitalist countries began running significant deficits (larger than 1 percent of GDP) virtually every year starting in the late 1970s. Under Reagan, the spending choices shifted from welfare to defense, butter to guns, and the deficits grew. Rather than pay for the growing edifice of state agencies by raising taxes, or making cuts elsewhere in the budget, governments borrowed more. Central government debt in the LCEs crept up from 21 percent of GDP in 1970 to 30 percent in 1980, surging to almost 120 percent on the eve of the pandemic and 140 percent during the pandemic.

As governments and central banks flushed more money into the economy with each crisis, they inflated the size of the financial markets. Liberal critics cast the post-Reagan boom in financial markets as a result mainly of deregulation, which did play a big role—but only in widening the options for investors. Their capital came mainly from governments and central banks, and their overconfidence was built on the promise of public bailouts.

Central banks used to be conservative institutions that bought only short-term government bonds to push money into a troubled economy, but in the crises of 2008 and 2020 they turned radical and experimental, expanding what kinds of bonds they would buy and from whom, to the point that in 2020 they were buying the junk debt of failing companies known as “sinking demons” and purchasing those debts from “shadow banks” like hedge funds and other private investors. They pushed easy money straight into the hands of the biggest players on Wall Street, which, despite their scale, can’t steer that many trillions efficiently. By the time the pandemic hit, capitalist economies were already being overtaken by monopolies and oligopolies, by the billionaires who own them, by firms that make no profit, and by a growing class of “zombie companies” that make too little profit to cover even the interest on their debt and survive by taking out new debt. All these creatures of credit thrived in the bailouts of 2020, which were seen by many as a creative emergency response to a hundred-year storm. Yet each new rescue built on those that came before, pushing the century-long expansion of the bailout culture to a risky new height, and setting a higher bar for the future.

The Reagan revolution spawned a conviction, which soon spanned the capitalist world, that deficits and debt don’t matter. From 1980 on, Republicans would propose tax cuts as the solution to every problem, claiming they would pay for themselves by generating more economic growth. Even if public debt rose, the economy would grow faster, easing the burden. Democrats would make the same case for spending on schools, health, or subsidies for manufacturing, arguing that social spending is “an investment” in the future. Either way, growth in the economy never kept up. The burden of public debt—measured as a share of GDP—mostly kept climbing.

Economies began to slow in the 2010s, not only in the LCEs but worldwide, in part for a reason beyond government control. The social revolutions of the 1960s and ’70s gave women the freedom to have fewer children. Birth rates started to fall, which meant fewer young adults entering the workforce in subsequent decades. Many governments would try to counter the population slowdown—for example, by giving families bonuses for having more children—but to little or no avail. Economic growth is a simple function of how many people are working, and how much each worker is producing. To boost economic growth in an era when fewer adults are entering the workforce, governments need to raise productivity—output per worker. Productivity growth allows companies to raise worker pay without increasing prices—generating higher economic growth without inflation. It has been called the magic key to prosperity, which it is. But like population growth, productivity growth has slowed sharply since 1980.

When capitalism works, it does so through what the Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.” Competition in the markets allows new firms to rise up and destroy the complacent ones, making the economy ever more productive over time. This process generates vast pools of wealth, personal and corporate, but only temporarily, as cut-rate competitors raze monopoly profits and concentrations of power. The downsides of this rough cyclical justice are more downturns in the economy and churn in the markets. The upside is human progress.

Government rescues made recessions few and far between, and less deep than they otherwise would have been. As more old and weak firms survived each downturn, America ceased to be the land of second chances, because so few established businesses were allowed to fail in the first place. As what researchers have called “the cleansing effect” of recessions disappeared, recoveries started to last longer but at a slower pace of growth, particularly after the dot-com crash of 2000.

By smothering capitalism’s competitive fire, big government is slowing productivity growth, which is lowering economic growth in the long run, thus shrinking the pie and concentrating what’s left in fewer hands. Millennials, the next ruling generation, have embraced a narrative that is clear on the problems of capitalism and way too certain of the causes. Like the media establishment, many Americans seem to assume that the story of shrinking government is true. They juxtapose it against the stark facts of giant corporations dominating the economy: the stock market value of the largest company skyrocketing above $3 trillion, the fortunes of the richest tycoons breaking $200 billion, CEO pay topping four hundred times the average staffer’s pay. If these distortions arose in a period of shrinking government, they figure, then bigger government must be the answer. But if the era of shrinking government never happened, that is exactly the wrong answer.

By 2023 the White House was pitching “Bidenomics” as a geopolitical masterstroke and a historic turning point. Its premise, as outlined by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, was that after World War II, the United States had built a global economic order that lifted millions out of poverty and “sustained thrilling technological revolutions.” In recent decades, however, this order had faltered on an “oversimplified” faith that “markets always allocate productively and efficiently.” Left to their own devices, it was the markets that had allocated capital to the rich over the middle class, to finance not manufacturing, and to China not the United States, leaving the construction of a green economy to Beijing. Thus the first pillar of Bidenomics was an “economic mentality that champions building.” It put government in charge of allocating capital—through spending and subsidies, regulations and trade barriers—to where the executive branch thinks it is needed most. Denying any intent to “pick winners,” the administration would aim instead to “unlock the power and ingenuity of private markets” through financial incentives, said Sullivan. And yet it had already picked three very specific winners indeed: advanced semiconductors, green technology, and precious minerals required in many green technologies, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. This “modern American industrial strategy” was part of “the new Washington consensus,” in which “like-minded” Western countries would rally to fight climate change and compete with China. Sullivan’s speech was titled “Renewing American Economic Leadership.”

China, where the state still plays the guiding role in investing capital—with increasingly disastrous results. As paramount leader Xi Jinping reimposed state control in the 2010s, China’s GDP growth rate slowed from well over 10 percent a year in nominal dollar terms to less than 5 percent by 2023. At that pace, China was no longer growing fast enough to surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy in the coming decades, if ever. Why follow the lead of a faltering rival? Former U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick called Biden’s vision a “Washington Ordered Economy,” and warned that its barriers, rules, and subsidies, once embedded, would be “hard to reverse.” By mid-2023, Biden had launched nearly $8 trillion in new spending, the largest surge ever, outside a world war or depression. Of that sum, roughly $2.3 trillion did go to the kind of investment in research and infrastructure that could be called “industrial policy.” But some $1.7 trillion went to Covid relief, $2 trillion to the military, and more than $2 trillion to new welfare benefits, including Medicare subsidies, disability benefits, and student loan forgiveness.

To date, capitalism has arguably gone more wrong in Europe, where the state has been even more inclined to rescue, bail out, and regulate, and growth in productivity and average incomes has slowed more than in the United States over the last two decades. Now, however, the two sides of the Atlantic may be swapping places, as big government grows faster in the United States.

Fueled by easy money and rising debt, those distortions include, most prominently, the increase in income and wealth inequality, the spread of zombie firms that live on fresh infusions of debt, and the rise of “bad” monopolies and oligopolies—the kind that thrive less on innovation than on strangling competition.

The intellectual consensus today, however, assumes that there is plenty of room for government to grow bigger, and more active, because it has been shrinking since the Reagan presidency. Flawed history will lead to misguided solutions. Expanding government from this new base—many times larger than it was in 1980—is likely to make the ongoing crisis of capitalism that much worse.

Alexander Hamilton. He wanted to establish a strong government to develop the young country, anchored by a central bank that would serve as the foundation for a private credit system, which in turn would fund the spread of commerce and industry, and the rise of cities. A financial visionary, Hamilton was ahead of his time. He tried to persuade his skeptical peers, steeped in Puritan values of self-reliance, that issuing public debt would be good for the economy. Only the interest would have to be repaid, while the principal would serve in essence as collateral for private lending, over time greatly expanding the credit supply—and the economy. “A national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing; it will be a powerful cement of our union,” he said. Hamilton would prevail, but only long after he was dead.

Hamilton’s archrival, Thomas Jefferson. The Jeffersonians envisioned America as a land of farmers, blessed by what they saw as the rugged virtues that come with landownership. And they saw Hamilton as the enemy, intent on turning America into old Britain: aristocratic, mired in corrupt commerce, built on a financial system that favored the rich city elite over the rural majority. In fact Hamilton did model his plans for a central bank on the Bank of England, which was one of the governing institutions through which sinecures and self-dealing enriched the Victorian elite.

a loosely Hamiltonian system started to work, albeit through a chaotic network of private banks, many issuing their own currencies—which numbered around eight thousand up to the Civil War. Credit began to flow in the familiar cycle of boom and bust, fueled on the way up by growing optimism and popped at the peak by obvious signs of excessive lending. Early on these cycles tended to spring out of the fields, usually of wheat or cotton, and on the frontiers—the South or West. They ended in the major panics of 1819 and 1837. Painful as they were, these crises punctuated but did not slow the economic expansion. In this period, the American South was growing richer than any nation other than England, yet it was falling behind the American North. The Industrial Revolution had started in England and by the 1820s it was crossing the Atlantic, seeding the first small textile mills in the northeastern states. Powered first by water and the labor of women and children, later by steam engines and immigrants from Europe, “the Northeast was likely the fastest-growing and richest economic region on earth,” writes historian Jonathan Levy. Between 1840 and 1860, its industrial output quintupled.

as capitalist economies bogged down in recent decades, slowing income growth, the result was a rise in zero-sum thinking. In a sluggish economy, people lose faith in the capacity of the system to “grow the pie rather than just redistribute portions of it.” They start to see getting ahead as improbable, hard work as pointless. Politics turn ugly as citizens jockey for toeholds in a darker future. Shrinking opportunities start to drain the life from what German sociologist Max Weber, in a work that first appeared in English in 1930, had called the optimistic “spirit of capitalism.”

Back then, the Industrial Revolution had created an expectation of human progress for the first time in history, and with it a decline in zero-sum thinking. A growing sense of possibility manifested itself in the Victorian values of hard work, thrift, consumption, and entrepreneurship. Having been inspired in the first instance by economic progress, the capitalist spirit faded as progress slowed. Since the 1970s, as the average rate of per capita income growth fell worldwide from nearly 3 percent a year to under 1 percent, pessimism and “demotivating” zero-sum beliefs spread.

They are pragmatic not ideological, and have been moving in the right direction, in terms of the timing and scale of regulatory and tax shifts. Above all they spend the public’s money wisely, which means targeting both growth and redistribution simultaneously, in order to boost the prospects of the poor without chasing millionaires off to Singapore or Dubai.

Taiwan’s combined fiscal and monetary stimulus amounted in 2020 to less than 7 percent of GDP, compared to 34 percent on average in the G4 economies: the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Though Taiwan’s corporate and personal tax rates are typical for a developed economy, the way its government spends that revenue is highly unusual: very light on social programs and health care, compared to its peers, and very heavy on education and research. The result is a record of extraordinarily dynamic and steady growth. Since Taiwan was formally recognized as a developed economy in the late 1990s, it has averaged close to 4 percent growth, more than twice as fast as the average for other developed economies. Taiwan maintained this edge, despite a rapidly aging population, by generating productivity growth far faster than that of any G4 economy every year for the last four decades.

From 2020 to 2023, Taiwan’s labor productivity was growing at an annual pace of nearly 4 percent, compared to 0.5 percent in the G4. One reason: manufacturing, the industry most closely associated with productivity gains, accounts for more than 30 percent of Taiwan’s GDP, a stunningly high share for any country, developed or not. It’s been said that to become rich a country needs to make rich things, and in this Taiwan particularly excels. The Observatory of Economic Complexity ranks Taiwan third in the world for the sophistication of its exports, testimony to the extraordinary range of skills required to manufacture fast computer chips.

One of capitalism’s biggest problems is the widespread misunderstanding of how China emerged as Asia’s latest “economic miracle.” Many experts have pointed to China’s five-decade run of strong growth as proof of how well a state-managed economy can work, and this in turn has created a vogue for “state capitalism.” China’s economic miracle did not prove the value of state control, quite the opposite. At its peak under the Qing dynasty in 1820 China was the most dominant economy in the historical records, accounting for 33 percent of global GDP. That position would erode as the Qing declined and fell, dropping to just 5 percent by the time of the Maoist rebellion in 1949—and there it stagnated under Communist control. Driven by misery and memories of past glory, China changed fast after the last Maoist regime fell in the late seventies, and quickly widened economic freedoms. By the 2010s, China’s share of global GDP was back over 15 percent, a hundred-year high. It was expanding, however, because the state was easing control over the economy. Growth took off after Beijing started to free private farmers and entrepreneurs to run their own shows. Even as growth picked up in private sector industries vacated by the state, it remained weak in rust belt industries heavily supported by the state. By 2021, the once nonexistent private sector had risen in four decades to account for 50 percent of tax revenue, 60 percent of GDP, 70 percent of tech innovation, and 80 percent of urban jobs. Yet

Like China, Vietnam began reforming in response to a period of total economic collapse. By the late 1980s, more than a decade after the end of its calamitous war of reunification, Vietnam was living on handouts from the Soviet Union, growth was stagnant, and inflation was running at 700 percent. Hanoi’s answer was doi moi, a series of reforms designed to open the state-run economy to the outside world and to private business. At the time, 70 percent of the population worked on farms and—as had been the case in China—the reforms began with agriculture. Collective farms were abolished, and the land was leased instead to individuals, who were allowed for the first time to sell their produce at a profit, at home or abroad. Output rose fast. Soon Vietnam made the transition from chronic rice importer, battling hunger at home, to rice exporter. The centerpiece of doi moi was dismantling the state-planned economy, streamlining the central bureaucracy, and scaling down or selling off state-owned monopolies. Round after round of sales reduced the number of state companies, from twelve thousand in 1989 to six hundred by 2016. The pace and reach of privatization ran much deeper in Vietnam than in any advanced capitalist country. That set the stage for a surge in economic growth, led by the private sector.

History shows that autocracies at every income level produce much less steady growth than democracies do. Facing no internal checks, they can change policy on a whim, or push policies to irrational extremes. Time and again, these shifts trigger collapses that drop the economy back to square one on the development path. That helps explain why today every large developed country is a full-fledged democracy, and the only partial exception is Singapore.

One way to tell where capitalism is working is to watch where the money and people go. When they were finally freed to leave the Soviet Union after its fall, Russian scientists moved mainly to countries with the lowest top income tax rates, especially to the United States. Within the fifty states, the population has been shifting for decades to those that promise lower taxes, lighter regulation, and the resulting overall reduction in labor costs (not just cheap wages). It’s difficult to directly compare internal and international migration, but since 1980 the United States has lost an estimated 3.5 million manufacturing jobs to China, while the Northeast and Midwest alone have lost more than 13 million people, including some 9 million working adults to the South and Southwest. As the Biden administration rolled out new incentives to boost investment in computer chips and green tech, the South was attracting twice as much of that investment as the Midwest and becoming “America’s industrial heartland.”

All of the fifteen fastest-growing U.S. cities by both percentage gain and total number were outside the old industrial belt of Middle America, mainly in the South. Miami is becoming Manhattan South. Americans tend to see this as a zero-sum game, one state cannibalizing from another, without recognizing the inherent advantage of a decentralized system that creates room for competition among states. The most competitive states are attracting investment from all over the world, acting as models in their own way.

When money has a price, the perverse incentives that fueled the rise of zombies, oligopolies, oligopolist billionaires, and the broad distortion of financial markets are no doubt much reduced. Even members of the political elite, who helped create and shape the easy money era, have started warning loudly that rising deficits put America in a “terrible place.” That’s a turn for the better, but it is just a start.

It was a Reagan appointee, Alan Greenspan, who in 1987 delivered the Fed’s first promise of support to a cratering market, a safety net that has never been withdrawn. Later Greenspan delivered the first rate cuts explicitly designed to speed up a recovery, and then to prolong a recovery even as financial imbalances built up. By the time all this easy money blew up with the collapse of the housing bubble in 2008, rates could hardly go lower, so the Fed borrowed a trick from Japan to push rates down by buying bonds in multibilliondollar bulk. Then it pushed that buying spree to a shocking scale in the pandemic, breaking the price signals that make capitalism work. What began in the New Deal as a safety net for the poor has become a system of socialized risk for the super-rich, with government guaranteeing markets that would move only one way, up. If the bias of policy makers before the start of the Depression was to “liquidate, liquidate, and liquidate,” it has given way to the opposite bias, “liquify, liquify, liquify.” Though often depicted as a bold departure, Bidenomics does not set a new direction, it wants more of everything that was already there: spending, regulation, bailouts for U.S. companies and the world, even an industrial policy to outdo China’s.

Empires can see the end coming in their currencies. Once the currency no longer looks safe, investors lose faith, and the empire effectively runs out of money. It holds auctions to sell its Treasury debt, and buyers don’t show up, or they show up only to demand cripplingly high yields in return for holding what they newly regard as shaky debts. It may not happen in a day but it can happen quickly. Suddenly the empire has no option other than to cut back and stop spending money it doesn’t have.

In his book Measuring Government in the Twenty-First Century, economist Livio Di Matteo promises “a few” samples, and ends up citing twenty studies. They show, for example, that the impact follows a curve: in the early stages an expanding state tends to spend on roads and other basics, promoting growth; after a certain point, added spending has diminishing returns, as more goes to less productive targets. Economic freedom, on the other hand, delivers increasing returns. Nations in the top quartile of the economic freedom rankings have an average income of $45,000, nearly eight times those in the bottom quartile.

The most consistent precursor of major financial crises is not the scale of debt but the pace of increase in debt. Debt manias are visible. Looking back to 1960 in 150 countries, my own research shows that when private sector debt is growing rapidly for five years or more, the economy typically slows over the next five years. The larger the debt buildup, the larger the slowdown. If, for example, debt was growing as a share of GDP by 5 percentage points a year, growth fell by a third in subsequent years. That finding aptly describes the United States before and after 2008.

Political leaders conduct increasingly radical experiments to revive and reshape the business environment, to this end or that, and the elite for the most part applaud. The hubris of economics, not nearly so hard a “science” as it would like to think, only grows. Governments and central banks face few objections, indeed they are encouraged by opinionmakers, to meddle: to force faster growth by injecting rivers of dollars into the economy, to divert capital flows through a concrete latticework of regulation, to nurture even zombies and other invasive species through bailouts. The physical sciences teach that life is a cycle of constant transformation, ashes to ashes; political leaders ignore that lesson when they listen to economic advisers claiming to know the secrets of constant growth, with no death, no ash. That’s not possible. They are claiming mastery over the cycle of life, and their arrogance needs to be recognized and contained, before it does more damage. Capitalism is still humanity’s best hope for economic and social progress, but only if it is free to work.

When each worker produces more, companies can raise wages without raising prices. The economy can grow without generating crippling inflation. The economic pie can grow steadily for everyone. If productivity growth is falling, as it has been for the last two decades, more and more people will be fighting over what is left. Productivity growth is the number that reveals whether capitalism is working. Its broad decline over the last five decades—a period of rapid technological progress—has been called the Solow Paradox, after Nobel laureate Robert Solow. In 1987 Solow pointed out—in an offhand remark in a book review—that “you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” His evidence was from studies showing that over the previous fifteen years or so, service firms were investing more in computers than manufacturing firms but gaining less in productivity. Some economists were even arguing that the spread of computers was lowering productivity growth.

Tech optimists offer two basic responses. One is that the productivity measurements do not capture the impact of digital technology: online search, for example, saves shoppers and researchers countless hours, but time not spent doesn’t show up in output figures. Or, they say, digital technology will raise productivity eventually, just wait. Even during the Industrial Revolution, new technologies did not raise productivity until a critical mass of businesses had figured out how to apply the latest innovations, whether steam, electric, or combustion engines. Once businesses learn how to apply the next big innovation, the next productivity boom will begin.

The productivity decline unfolded in two waves, the first from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s; the second, even more rapid decline started around 2005. Those periods of decline were interrupted by a brief revival, limited mainly to the United States. What, other than the computer revolution, dates to the 1970s? The relentless rise in government intervention, and the dysfunctions that come with it, including the massive misallocation of capital into unproductive and profitless companies.

Firms start to show signs of severe decay two years before they can no longer cover their interest payments, and fall into the zombie class. As they fall deeper into debt, they start investing less, and selling off assets. Compared to healthy firms, their investment growth is 2 to 3 percentage points lower for hard assets like factories and machines, and 3 to 4 percentage points lower for soft assets, like software or branding. Once they have transformed into zombies, their stock of assets of all kinds, machines or brand image, has fallen on average to less than half that of a normal company. Having so little to work with, zombies generate less profit and create fewer jobs. Their employment growth is nearly 10 percentage points lower on average than that of a normal firm.

Before 2000, that was still true. Healthy firms were able to borrow at significantly lower cost, and faced less pressure to sell off assets. Then, over the last two decades, increasingly friendly government “forbearance” narrowed what should be the natural advantages of healthy firms. With governments and central banks waging a campaign to keep weak companies alive, zombies became stubbornly difficult to dislodge. The result is one industry after another clogged with zombies, generating “congestion effects” that undermine the health of all companies in that industry. Instead of killing off zombies, competitors start showing similar traits. Every dollar the zombies in an industry borrow, every worker they hire, and every machine they buy makes it more expensive for healthy rivals to borrow, invest, and hire. At the same time, zombies create an excess of supply that pushes prices down and makes it even more difficult for healthy companies to survive in the industry or for new competitors to enter it.

when governments are backstopping loans from all banks, the blanket subsidy encourages “diabolical sorting”: in effect, zombie banks supporting weak companies.

Though monopolies and oligopolies have an unfailingly bad reputation among the general public, economists have always taken a more ambiguous view. Even Joseph Schumpeter distinguished between good and bad monopolies. The bad ones rise and hold on to power by exploiting government contacts and regulations, invest little, and do nothing to raise productivity. Good ones rise on the strength of innovation, kill off rivals who do not innovate, and have a positive impact on productivity.

If towns banned Walmart, the local market would lose fewer businesses and would appear less concentrated and more competitive. But Walmart was far more productive than the typical Main Street retailer because of the way it applies digital technology to managing its stores. If towns welcomed Walmart, weaker local retailers would go out of business, and the market might appear less competitive—but productivity would go up.

Productivity is falling across the board in these industries, particularly in the laggard companies but even in the leaders, for two basic reasons.

Mian, Liu, and Sufi, the economists who first cast oligopolies as creations of easy money, also argue that they became major contributors to falling productivity. Before 2000, falling interest rates were encouraging more competition, leading to the productivity boom of the dot-com era. Afterward, as rates fell closer and closer to zero, low rates encouraged industry consolidation by giving dominant players an even greater incentive to kill off competitors, slowing productivity growth. This, they wrote, offers a new “unified explanation” for the ills afflicting modern capitalism over the last two decades, with the rise of oligopolies, the fall of small businesses, and the resulting decline in productivity growth all driven by the same force: easy money.

the corporate bureaucracy springs to a large degree from the regulatory state, demanding ever more HR analysts and compliance officers to make sure staff are toeing the state line. Workers in advanced capitalist countries now spend as much as 16 percent of their time dealing with reviews, trainings, attestations, and other forms of red tape. Academic surveys estimate that at least half that time has no productive value. The total losses for the U.S. economy amounted to $3 trillion in 2016, or about 17 percent of GDP that year. If this burden had been reduced by half over the next ten years, wrote Hamel and Zanini, productivity growth would have increased “by a compounded rate of 1.3 percent annually, essentially doubling the post-2007 productivity growth rate.”

whatever the circumstances that dictate an act of collective violence, small or large, warfare has been practiced in every region of the world and through manifold changes in social and political organization, suggesting that there are fundamental explanations for the cause of war in general. Otherwise, human communities would have chosen to behave differently. Human beings, principally the males, are the only animal species that over long evolutionary time have killed their own kind in large numbers, often inflicting violence with calculated cruelty, irrespective of sex or age. This is true for human beings thousands of years ago and is true in the savage conflicts that have already marked the first quarter of the twenty-first century. For the argument that men, modern men in particular, have an aversion to killing others, there is the counterevidence that in the Second World War, it was possible to take 100 million men, a cross section of their societies, and, after often brief spells of training, to get them to bomb, shell, shoot, and bayonet millions of their fellow species.

There are several levels of explanation for the exceptional violence displayed by humans. The first level comprises the general causes, internal and external, that have affected human evolution. That humans have adapted biologically to engage in violence when necessary to preserve the gene pool and secure reproductive success now seems likely to be the first building block in explaining intraspecific conflict. Warfare is on this reading not in our genes but for our genes.

The second level of explanation moves from the general context for warfare to specific motives to act. Human beings acted and act within the broad parameters already outlined, but they do so from conscious motives. These can be broadly defined under the four headings explored in the four chapters of part II: resources, belief, power, and security. These are not mutually exclusive, because it is likely, for example, that pursuit of power will also enhance security, just as it is likely to bring additional resources. A war for belief may also bring resource advantages, as it did briefly for the crusaders, and at the same time increase the security of the faith. In most cases, however, it is possible with wars ancient and modern to isolate the principal motive behind any given conflict. It is also possible for a single ambitious individual, an Alexander or Napoleon, to supply the driving force for warfare—a unique and unpredictable cause difficult to integrate with the broader parameters of warfare or with the common range of motives. These motives are, like the level of general factors, universal rather than historically contingent. The search for security, the pursuit of power, the greed for others’ resources, wars for faith or ideology are built into the human condition.

The idea that war is programmed to die out is impossible to reconcile with the crop of conflicts since 2000 or with the anticipated ecological crisis, resource stress, and religious conflict in the coming decades that could result in the kinds of war for which there is a long historical pedigree. There are scant grounds for thinking that a warless world is about to emerge from the current or future international order. The causes of war have been persistent for millennia.

there are other forms of “future warfare” that have attracted a good deal of popular attention. The first is cyberwar, the deliberate and aggressive effort to disrupt the computer network operations of a rival or enemy. This has so far been attempted only by Russia, against Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2022–2023. Cyberattacks can be directed at military and civilian networks, undermining daily life as well as military communications and capability.

The same might be said of the threat of war in space. General agreement since the 1970s that space ought to be a weaponless sanctuary has been progressively challenged as more states put satellites into orbit and develop the technology capable of knocking out or blinding a rival satellite, as China has shown with antisatellite exercises over the past decade. Because satellite communication has a vital military dimension, there has been growing concern about how to defend against war fighting in space. In 2017, the United States set up US Space Command and the US Space Force with a brief like the one for the cyberwar command, to develop antisatellite capability and forms of satellite defense, which includes the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program, a title that would flatter H. G. Wells or the cast of Star Trek.

Warfare viewed through the two levels of explanation, the general context framing the specific motives, can be understood as a mixture of imperatives that have remained remarkably constant over human history, though the mix can vary from case to case. The complex ways in which warfare has been shaped by natural imperatives and human agency operating in tandem means abandoning the idea that explaining warfare can be simple. There remains what Azar Gat has called “the causal array that leads to war.”4 This still leaves work for the historian, as every war will have its own narrative and actors, but at the level of a general answer to the question “Why War?,” the causal nexus has a universal applicability.

the natural environment in which humans evolved supplied external imperatives to act violently when ecological resources were depleted and human competition for them intensified. These general causes can be traced through time and space and can be found to operate even in the recent past or, in the case of climate change or militarized culture, in the present.

Psychologists discuss the notion of deferred payoff and the inability to delay one's gratification as a hindrance. They hold that people who prefer a dollar now versus two in the future will eventually fare poorly in the course of life. But this is not at all what Spitz's idea is about, since you do not know whether there might be a payoff at the end of the line, and, furthermore, psychologists are shoddy scientists, wrong almost all the time about almost all the things they discuss. The idea that delayed gratification confers some socioeconomic advantage to those who defer was eventually debunked. The real world is a bit different. Under uncertainty, you must consider taking what you can now, since the person offering you two dollars in one year versus one today might be bankrupt then (or serving a jail sentence).

The latter point allows she or he who is perseverant and mentally equipped to do the right thing with an endless reservoir of suckers. Never underestimate people's need to look good in the eyes of others. Scientists and artists, in order to cope with the absence of gratification, had to create such a thing as prizes and prestige journals. These are designed to satisfy the needs of the nonheroics to look good on the occasion. It does not matter if your idea is eventually proved right; there are intermediary steps in between that can be won. So “research” will be eventually gamed into some brand of nonresearch that looks cosmetically like research. You publish in a “prestige” journal and you are done, even if the full idea never materializes in the future. The game creates citation rings and clubs in fields like academic finance and economics (with no tangible feedback) where one can BS endlessly and collect accolades by peers.

what became an overengineered decorative tower sitting on an office building roof serendipitously morphed into opportunity—an observation deck 1,050 feet (320 m) in the air. Not only does that deck draw millions of tourists, but it was also the serendipity that helped the owners keep from losing their building during the Great Depression. The observatory was a cash cow that, in the first full year of operation, brought in nearly $800,000 in revenue, while the building’s offices generated $1 million.

Our desire to get on with our lives—to work, live, and play—and do it in cities generates a kind of natural order, of steel, concrete, glass, and brick rising out of the ground, in the way that ants build mounds, or bees their hives. Cities, by definition, are large, dense clusters of humans and the institutions that support them. Ultimately, skyscrapers are the solution to a geography problem—how to allow many people to be in the same place at the same time. Skyscrapers pinch geography by creating land in the sky.

The skyscraper is the lingua franca of urban real estate. It is arguably the one building form that brings us together, literally because so many people can be inside at the same time, and because of what each represents—the triumph of our universal aspirations. Skyscraper chroniclers Earle Shultz and Walter Simmons summarized this idea nicely in 1959 when they wrote: “The character and quality of any city can be told from a great distance by its skyline, but these buildings do more than advertise a city. They show the faith of many in its destiny, and they create a like faith in others.”

If barriers are created to make something artificially scarce, it raises the stakes and suppliers will find a way to game the system to cater to the demand. When you try eliminating something people want, you wind up generating more unintended consequences than if you created a more rational and reasonable policy that better balanced the trade-offs. When cities try to limit needed skyscrapers, they get higher real estate prices, more inequality, fewer employment opportunities, and more automobile-based sprawl.

Skyscrapers can only be built when the culture, beliefs, and mores about them mean that society thinks they are useful. In this sense, society is the patron and the city that builds them is the client. As an example, we can look at the Shard, completed in London in 2012 and rising to 1,016 feet (310 m). The lead developer, Irvine Sellar, hired Renzo Piano, a world-famous architect, to design his structure. Here Sellar was the patron and Piano the client. Sellar did not have the money to build the $2 billion structure himself, so he turned to investors. When the 2007–2008 financial crisis hit, he lost his main backer, Credit Suisse. In its place, he found the Qatari government, which stepped in with the funds. In this way, the State of Qatar was the patron and Sellar was the client. Qatar has made its fortune from the sale of crude oil, which eventually winds up in your car’s gas tank. So that makes you a patron, as well. But even with Piano’s elegant design, British officials still demanded it go through a rigorous approval process, the outcome of which was highly uncertain. British officials now became the patron, who had to bestow their approval on Piano and Sellar. Nonetheless, the venture’s success depended on the income that would be generated. The building had to be filled with revenue-producing tenants and visitors. Here the “patrons” are the occupants who make the building pay. Sellar inked a deal with the Shangri-La Hotel to occupy eighteen stories, and the top floors house the observatory. Between the hotel and the observatory are rented apartments. The bottom thirty-one floors are offices, whose occupants include Tiffany & Co., Al-Jazeera, and the Warwick Business School. Now that the Shard is open for business and humming away, London has embraced it. The nickname also adds value to the London brand of skyscraper. The building is featured in postcards, social media, and documentaries and is part of the soul of modern London. In this way, London has become the client of the Shard, which stands as a crystal prince, a knight in the city.

For skyscrapers to work, they must satisfy a hierarchy of needs. First, they must be safe from fire, wind, or collapse. Second, they must be occupiable—the interior spaces need to be comfortable and contain modern conveniences. Lastly, they must adequately project our desires and what we wish to communicate to the outside world, as they help define our identities. And all this must be done at a cost that is below the income the occupants generate. Without efficient and economic solutions to these problems, a building’s height is irrelevant.

Since time immemorial, the tallest buildings in cities were rarely more than five stories. Church spires or clock towers were the exceptions that proved the rule. The original thirteenth-century spire of Notre Dame de Paris was 256 feet (78 m) high, while the Great Clock of Westminster, aka Big Ben, completed in 1859, rises to 316 feet (96 m). But when it came to living and working, few were willing to climb more than five stories or 50 vertical feet, and space on the top floors had the lowest value. The elevator, along with other innovations, flipped the profitability of renting out higher floors. As a result, developers now had an incentive to go taller, and taller they went, starting in New York in the early 1870s and then in other major cities throughout the United States. This growth spurt was nothing short of revolutionary, like the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.

The modern “true” skyscraper after 1890 was a relatively tall structure that contained four key components. First, it required an all-steel frame of columns, beams, and girders. Second, these steel members had to be riveted together to form one continuous latticework. Third, the structure needed extra steel for the sole purpose of wind bracing (and in some cases against seismic activity). Lastly, the façade itself was to be a mere curtain. That is, it served no structural purpose, and its primary functions were to keep out the elements, allow for access to sunlight, and offer the viewer a pleasing architectural statement.

Defining the first is what architectural historian Thomas Leslie says is akin to defining the first fish. As he told me, “The evolution of the ‘fish’ happened very gradually.

Chicago’s skyline erupted from the fortuitous confluence of economic, technological, and social conditions that were present in the early decades of the United States. Chicago’s true legacy is not only the supply side—the design and construction of skyscrapers—but what drove the demand. Thus, the real story is that Chicago had, unwittingly, produced a fertile and dynamic environment where developers could bring forth a new building type to satisfy the needs of Chicago’s business community. So, what were these magic ingredients? First and foremost was its central location within the American continent. Before the first brick was even laid, Chicago’s greatness was nearly a foregone conclusion. As the economist Homer Hoyt relays: The pioneers of empire hunted for such a spot before they had ever seen it, and during the many decades that intervened between its first discovery and its actual settlement the advantages of its site entered into the calculations of ministers in the capitals of Europe. Its location was carefully marked on the maps of North America as a place of strategic importance by those who never caught a glimpse of the dismal swamp that seemed to belie all promise of its future greatness. Chicago was the lowest point in a barrier between three water-based highway systems. To the west were the mighty Mississippi River and all its tributaries. To the east were the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. And in 1825, New York completed the Erie Canal, which connected the Hudson River to the Great Lakes. Chicago was thus a node that united a growing nation.

In 1827, Congress approved land grants for a canal to link Lake Michigan to the Illinois River, which drains into the Mississippi. In 1830, Chicago was mapped and platted, and in 1833 it was incorporated. In 1836, the state of Illinois authorized the canal’s construction. The once and future Metropolis-on-the-Prairie was born. But a city could not be created simply from charters and blueprints. Investments needed to be made. Buildings needed to be built. Roads needed to be laid. Labor needed to arrive. And marketplaces needed to emerge. And so, the army of would-be capitalists marched forth from the East to build—and finance—Chicago. The bankers supplied the money, the ambitious supplied the talent, and the penniless immigrant supplied the labor. The great nexus of trade and commercial flows was born. The canal was finally completed in 1848. But, in an unexpected twist of fate, while the canal created the idea of Chicago, it was the railroad that made it so. The first road, also completed in 1848, was a short experimental line eight miles west of the Loop. After that, lines began to expand out from the center into a dense transportation web. Just as important in this centrality was the boundless hinterland, which funneled cheap resources and commodities into Chicago, where they were processed, marketed, and distributed far and wide. The Union Stock Yards, for example, established just after the Civil War, were annually processing about 2 million head of cattle and about one hundred thousand hogs by 1875. Two decades later, that figure was up to 6 million and 2.5 million, respectively. The forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin produced an immense wood supply, and by 1890, 2.9 million tons of timber entered Chicago’s port, and 2 million tons of grain arrived from the hinterland. As one geographer put it, Chicago was “a colossal hopper into which the grain fields of the whole West pour their harvests, and made of the lake route one of the great delivery chutes to the densely populated industrial regions of the United States and Europe.” This centrality produced, arguably, the fastest growth of any city in human history. In 1830, Chicago comprised twelve huts. Four decades later, it was the fourth-largest city in the country; twenty years after that it was officially the Second City.

just as Chicago was getting its economic groove, in October 1871, Mrs. O’Leary’s cow, as legend would have it, unwittingly ignited a massive conflagration that destroyed much of the city. But Chicago was reborn—literally and figuratively—from its ashes. The burned material was used to raise the city’s grade several feet to lift itself out of its own “dismal swamp.” And because of the clearing away of the old, dilapidated rookeries, new polished office buildings, like the Rookery (1888), could rise in their place. The Great Chicago Fire (1871) The need to organize the importing, processing, marketing, and exporting of the tremendous quantity of commodities gave rise to an industrial bureaucracy. Banks were financing corporations; insurance companies were reducing risk; and headquarters were overseeing their operations. To facilitate marketing, the Chicago Board of Trade became a powerful boost to the city’s economy. Over time, the Board helped establish standards for the inspection of flour, pork, and lumber and eventually became the most important commodities futures exchange in the nation. In 1885, the Board completed its ten-story skyscraper in the Loop with a massive trading hall and its sinking supertall clock tower.

The depression following the Financial Panic of 1873, however, sent Chicago’s economy into a lull. When commerce finally began to pick up in 1879, there was a great office shortage, as much of it had disappeared in the Great Fire. That the Loop was hemmed in at first by the Chicago River and Lake Michigan and then by the elevated railroad and railyards meant tremendous pressure on the market price of its soil, which incentivized the construction of tall buildings.

If you read the writings of the architects who created the Chicago School of Architecture, their aesthetics—including the rejection of ornamentation—were based on what would work economically and were less bound by the dictates of the European architectural scene. Far off in the prairie where practicality and speed ruled the day, the Chicago architects set themselves to the task of creating a new architecture. The famous dictate of Louis Sullivan, the quintessential creator of the Chicago School of Architecture, “that form ever follows function” was an artistic rationalization of real estate development—architectural realpolitik. Sullivan’s words were a direct admission that beauty had to be born from the economic realities of modern office space, where layout, access to light, and provision of creature comforts were paramount.

Only by the mid-nineteenth century did it dawn on society that the business community was worthy of architecture. At first, it was given what architects believed was architecture: versions of European Renaissance, Gothic, or classical. Banks had Roman and Greek styles to telegraph their soundness and stability. Insurance companies built their headquarters in Second Empire French or Italian Renaissance styles. Then the Chicago architects came along and—radically and shockingly—said that business deserves its own aesthetic. Catholic bishops got the Notre Dame de Paris. The Ming emperors got the Forbidden City. And the Home Insurance Company got its offices in Chicago. This was because Chicago developers demanded something new from the designers they hired. New corporations doing new types of work wanted new buildings to be comfortable both on the inside and out and to reflect their values and ambitions

Though the world has become more complex and interconnected, a skyscraper today is built from scratch as much as it was in Chicago circa 1890. While the details and methods have changed, the key steps are the same: Find and buy a lot in a central area, plan the ideal building, raise money, erect the structure, fill it with people, and earn profits. Repeat.

As cities grew and more economic activity was taking place there, businesses and residents had more to lose by fire, which had been the scourge of cities ever since humanity settled down. In the early nineteenth century, fire insurance became a vital industry and was a driving force in providing companies the security to get on with their affairs. Fire insurance thus fueled the first generation of skyscrapers. The history of the Home Insurance Company of New York illustrates this. After witnessing fire after fire—including in New York in 1835 and 1845—a group of noninsurance businessmen formed the Home Insurance Company in 1853 with the goal of providing insurance across the country.

in 1893, just as the city was getting its skyscraper mojo, it gave it all up. In that year, Chicago banned skyscrapers, making it illegal to build anything taller than 130 feet (38 m, 10 floors). The city would keep some form of height limits well into the twentieth century. But New York City did what Chicago did not. It ran with the skyscraper and continued to innovate. Gotham not only changed with the times but also changed the times. It showed the world not to be afraid of height but rather to embrace it. In the process, New York created a skyline metropolis that was the envy of the world and laid the foundations for the twenty-first-century global quest for skyscrapers and skylines.

The low-hanging fruit is to allow more mixed uses within buildings and to convert as many offices as possible into residences. The postwar towers with sprawling floor plates are difficult to convert and must be repurposed or demolished. And the high cost of housing keeps young people from joining the mix. Meanwhile, city planners are moving glacially to rewrite the old, outdated rules. But a look at office cycles over the last century suggests that what’s happening in America is a crisis of degree, not kind. After the Roaring Twenties boom, vast acres of office space lay dormant for a decade and a half. The oil crises of the 1970s and then the office glut of the late 1980s were each followed by rebounds. Some busts took longer to recover from, but they all dissipated just the same. The reason: populations rise and markets work. As prices fall, construction slows down, gluts eventually become shortages, and the market grows again.

Skyrocketing home prices mean there’s ample opportunity to provide more housing in tall buildings. The developing world has a rising middle class, and many of them will opt for living and working in tall buildings. As our world moves toward Terranism, global cities will have increasingly global real estate to cater to the demand, and tall buildings will be part of the solution. A decarbonizing world might mean fewer tall buildings without cheap fossil fuels. And this is a perfectly reasonable response. But I suspect, as we adjust to climate change, the tall building will, in fact, be more important. Coastal cities, with rising sea levels, will see their urban footprints shrink. This will put pressure on land values, which will incentivize tall buildings in other parts of the city. Tall buildings will likely prove more resilient. Plant and equipment can be placed on higher floors, and if properly designed the ground floors can better withstand flooding. It will often be cheaper to erect new buildings than to retrofit older ones for a post-carbon world.

The structural innovations have also allowed skyscrapers to become ultrathin, as measured by the aspect or slenderness ratio, calculated by dividing the building’s height by its width at the base. The Empire State Building’s aspect ratio is 3 (that is, its height is three times its width); the Chrysler Building is 5, the Sears (Willis) Tower is 6.5, and the Burj Khalifa is 9. A standard American ruler is 12 inches by 1 inch, hence an aspect ratio of 12. The crop of Billionaires’ Row buildings tops this. The aspect ratio for 432 Park Avenue is 15. The new record holder for the world’s skinniest skyscraper is the Steinway Tower on West 57th Street, nearly two rulers stacked on top of each other, at 23.5.

While urban residents love their old skyscrapers, they work to prevent new ones in their neighborhoods. They blame skyscrapers for all sorts of urban ills, and, in a way, a wider disconnect has grown between what economists and real estate professionals have come to know and what ordinary folks feel. The problem in the twenty-first century is that this disconnect is often driving local planning policies and creating a backlash out of proportion to the problem’s magnitude. That the rich can pay more for things really gets a lot of people’s goats. There is a widespread sentiment to the effect of, “Someone obtaining such luxury that we can’t have is not fair, and their giant, obnoxious buildings are casting shadows in my city.” Certainly, when capitalism produces multimillion-dollar empty condos floating above a homeless man sleeping on the street, it is appalling and paradoxical. And cities with many skyscrapers are expensive places to live. Take Hong Kong, which ranks among the most expensive in the world. Is it because of its skyscrapers? Many people seem to think so. In February 2021, I posted a blog discussing an academic research paper on building heights around the world that I wrote with two colleagues (discussed later). The aim of the paper was to look at why tall buildings are “missing” from some countries and yet seem to grow like weeds in others. One of the findings was that Ireland is the country with the most “missing” tall buildings. That is, given its wealth and urbanization, we would expect it to have more skyscrapers were it not so tightly regulated.

costs in cities are not independent of the benefits. If a particular neighborhood needs and wants more housing, then it can be economically rational to build taller than minimum-cost housing to get the supply to match the demand. Tall buildings exist in a larger housing ecosystem, which constitutes a continuum from shanties to mansions and ultraluxury condos and everything in between. The supply and demand in each submarket are linked to the submarket just above and below, making all housing units and all neighborhood markets part of an interconnected web. Growth in a particular submarket will then cause higher vacancies in the submarket below, which reduces their prices, making the lower-quality housing more affordable. This is called filtering, and it means that the best way to help lower-income residents is to build tons of middle-class housing and let the poor choose from the less expensive, former middle-class housing.

if supply lowers prices and makes more housing available why don’t people recognize it? The problem is that housing supply and demand are locked in a perennial wrestling match. All great cities exist in a race between the two; when supply can’t keep up with demand, housing becomes more unaffordable. In places like London, New York, Vancouver, and Hong Kong, people see luxury condos going up with the cost of living. To many, it must be the case that these luxury condos are causing rising prices. But again, the truth is the opposite—the demand to live in these places is so great and the supply is so limited that global cities with international demand become like a game of musical chairs: the rich or their children get the pick of the litter, while the rest are steaming with resentment. It’s also important to keep these tall buildings in perspective. New York City, for example, has 3.6 million residential units, and only 5 percent of them are in buildings that are thirty stories or taller (and 1 percent in buildings fifty stories or taller). So, luxury high-rises are not driving the high cost of housing in New York.

Real estate laws, in many countries, such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Panama, frequently don’t require purchasers to reveal their identities. Thus, a wealthy buyer will hire an attorney who forms a shell corporation and handles the transaction. The ill-gotten cash is slid from suitcase to shell corporation to condo suite and dirty money becomes clean. In 2015, two journalists for the New York Times, Louise Story and Stephanie Saul, investigated the buyers at the Time Warner Center (now the Deutsche Bank Center), a fifty-five-story, twin-towered Manhattan office and condo skyscraper, designed by SOM and completed in 2004.

If rising prices (from money laundering or legal means) generate new supply quickly to cater to this demand, then the price effects can be neutralized. But arguably, the main concern is how money laundering affects the prices of the lower and middle classes. Here the connection is more tenuous. If money laundering raises the prices of superluxury high-rise condos, it will then raise the demand for those units below the ultraluxury level as some rich people decide to “downgrade.” This will raise the prices for these units, which in turn increases the demand for those units below them, and so on. But how far does the process go? I would argue it’s not all that likely to spill far down to the middle-class housing in the outer parts of the city. Here, again, the real problem of affordability is not money laundering by the corrupt superrich, but that not enough housing is being built outside the central city where it is needed the most.

rising inequality in the West is bad. The traditional justification of inequality was that it linked effort with reward. The poor, it is argued, will tolerate poverty because they believe that with hard work and thrift, they or their children could rise into the middle class. But if poverty is simply a mire from which the poor never rise, then effort and thrift are decoupled from their rewards, which can ultimately lead to a downward economic and political spiral. U.S. administrations have been particularly bad about addressing inequality and, in fact, those on the right are exploiting it for their own political gain to the detriment of the commonweal. The West, particularly the United States, needs to address income inequality by raising tax rates on the superrich, along with government programs for the poor, such as free job retraining or community college attendance, subsidies to move people from high-unemployment to low-unemployment regions, and better access to health- and childcare. To lower the cost of living and increase savings, there needs to be a more concerted effort to make housing more affordable. The best way to do this is to subsidize the construction of middle-income housing and eliminate burdensome zoning requirements.

it’s the restrictions on new housing that have given property owners monopoly power, which has increased their wealth. After Piketty’s book was released, it was soon discovered that much of the gains driving wealth inequality, in fact, came from property ownership. Pro-homeownership policies were meant to promote community and enhance personal savings, but they inadvertently pushed people to think more like a bank to preserve their return on investment. Skyscrapers, in and of themselves, are not the real drivers of income inequality, but rather it’s the restricted property markets more broadly.

compared the number of tall buildings in each country to what it “should” have if its real estate market was less regulated and more fluid. By this metric, we found the world is “missing” six thousand Empire State Buildings. While this seems astronomically high, our analysis also reveals that the rise in the global construction gaps tracks very closely to the rise in global housing prices, suggesting that these missing buildings are helping to fuel global unaffordability. European countries are the most reluctant to build up. As noted earlier, Ireland is the “winner”—it is the country that is “missing” the most tall buildings, given its wealth and global importance. Regulations in Switzerland, for example, give strong veto power to those opposed to skyscrapers, and, as a result, there are only five tall buildings in Zurich, one of the world’s wealthiest cities and a financial hub. Interestingly, the United States makes it into the top twenty of the most-likely-to-be-missing-skyscrapers list. The reason is California. Despite its large wealth—its economy is larger than that of Mexico and India, respectively—it has implemented stringent building height regulations in the name of reducing congestion and improving the quality of urban life. Just as importantly, we find that higher gaps correlate with more expensive housing prices, greater urban sprawl, more traffic congestion, and more air pollution,

If you look at Tokyo, for example, its population is rising, even if Japan’s is not, and, by and large, housing is affordable because there is constant densification and construction of new units. It doesn’t hurt that Japanese residents are seemingly content to live in apartments half the size that is acceptable to Americans. But it does show that when a metropolis embraces new supply policies, affordability can follow.

Planners by their very nature seek to impose order and to “micromanage” a city to eliminate what they perceive as messiness and chaos. The planners’ visions in the past backfired because cities cannot be arranged like pieces on a chessboard. The overly stringent zoning regulations that “felt good” to planners in the mid-twentieth century are causing terrible affordability problems today because the politics of undoing them is too explosive, even though these regulations have been made obsolete with our vast improvements in health and technology. If there’s one lesson from urban economics: listen to the land values. As put succinctly by planner and writer Alain Bertaud, allocating land via the market sends strong signals through prices when land is underused or the use is unsuitable for its location;… provides a strong incentive to users to use as little land as possible in areas where there is a strong demand, in particular in areas well served by transport networks; and… stimulates innovation in construction; without land prices, there would have been no skyscrapers, no steel frames, and no elevators.

Land values represent the value of geography. Central places are more valuable than suburban ones. So, there should be more tall buildings in the center and fewer tall buildings outside. In popular suburban neighborhoods, there should be the flexibility to build low- and mid-rise apartment buildings if need be. The suburbs don’t need tall buildings if there is no demand, but let people vote with their dollars and feet. New construction means that, occasionally, older buildings must go. Preservationists will squawk that this means the end of historical cities. One solution might be to reduce what can be saved (though that’s not what people want to hear). Another option is to preserve the façades but let higher buildings rise in the middle of the blocks. Yet another option is to “enclose” the historical districts with surrounding high-rise districts. It’s crucial to reiterate: If you limit supply in the most valued locations, you need to find places nearby to add it.

planners should reduce building restrictions as neighborhood vacancies fall below, say, 5 percent. Let demand dictate supply. Allow accessory dwelling units (ADUs) or the conversion of garages for apartments in the suburbs, allow taller buildings near rail lines, and allow for skyscrapers in the central cities. Cities should buy up underutilized plots and sell the land leases to developers to densify them. This way, cities can actively encourage new housing exactly where it’s needed and at an affordable price. Officials also need to simultaneously add social services, upgrade parks, and invest in transportation improvements as new units come online. However, one of the biggest obstacles is the fear that homeowners will find their house values plummeting as the neighborhood redevelops. Ironically, a densifying community will see increased land values, which would help existing homeowners. But one proposal to mitigate NIMBYism has been put forth by William Fischel, Professor Emeritus at Dartmouth College, one of the world’s foremost experts on zoning. His idea is that homeowners could take out an insurance policy that would pay out at the time of selling if their land values declined because of loosening restrictions. Since land values are determined by the nature and characteristics of the neighborhood and economic development more broadly, insurance can help assuage concern that changes will wipe out homeowners’ equity through no fault of their own. And what about public housing? Across the world, cities like Hong Kong, Vienna, and Singapore demonstrate that it can work. However, public housing needs to be open to all residents except the very rich, and money needs to be set aside for ongoing maintenance and upgrades.

In a way, we are confronted with a strange paradox. We are convinced that high-rise living is bad for us, and yet central cities throughout the world keep building up and up. Even the Netherlands, not known for its embrace of the skyscraper, is planning to build some two hundred high-rises in the ensuing decades. Even outside Asia, from Rio to Austin to Toronto to Sydney, middle-class high-rise apartments are increasingly being constructed. No doubt it is because our future is an urban one. Nearly 60 percent of the world’s population lives in cities, and in the next decades that figure is likely to reach 80 percent and we will continue erecting our urban habitat. The key argument of this book has been that we have our skyscrapers because we want and need them. Their existence is due to the underlying economics of cities: skyscrapers rise when the demand for certain locations exceeds the land’s ability to accommodate it. The skyscraper is a geography-shrinking machine.

High-rise living is bad when people are economically “trapped” and feel compelled to take cheap subsidized housing because they desperately need shelter they can afford. In this sense, the problem is choice—the ability to decide where to live and how high must be based on the weighing of the costs and benefits, along with the feeling that your housing choice conforms to the societal norm of “good” and “proper” housing. On the other hand, in modern East Asian cities, high-rise living is typical. And when researchers started asking people about the quality of their lives there, the answers were that health, on average, was not that much different on higher floors than that of those living on lower floors. And people had great views and cleaner air. In my own research, I have found that the building type that people live in does not affect their housing satisfaction once you consider, or control for, how they feel about other important elements. People are satisfied with high-rise living if their building is clean, well maintained, and safe. Just as importantly, they are happier if they feel their current housing choice is close to or matches their preferred option.

Good cities are like playgrounds for kids of all ages; they are exciting and full of whatever kinds of activities you seek, and in good high-rise cities you can flow easily in both vertical and horizontal directions, providing truly three-dimensional experiences. The biggest drag on cities, however, is the overreliance on automobiles. If we opened our streets to pedestrians and allowed for a panoply of other forms of transit, we would be that much better off. Automobile-centric cities mean large spaces devoted to moving, parking, and storing these self-powered boxes. They provide less ability for residents and visitors to interact with the city and other people.

City officials, planners, architects, and developers need to be on the same page to provide not only better streetscapes and more housing but also more enjoyable housing. Factors that encourage people to remain in their buildings and get to know each other are helpful. In this regard, there is a certain benefit to “horizontality.” Architects and developers must think more about enhancing this horizontality within their buildings, such as having unenclosed stairwells between floors or creating more common areas. Social spaces in the building are vital, such as playrooms for children, roof decks, or party spaces. Because of the COVID pandemic and the work-from-home movement, residential and commercial building owners are increasingly feeling the pressure to amenitize their buildings with these kinds of areas. This trend should be encouraged by cities since there is less incentive to provide them when they eat into otherwise valuable rentable space.

Ever since the days of David Ricardo, two centuries ago, economists have taught that countries should specialize in those activities they perform most efficiently and import the rest. But “comparative advantage,” already suspect because of the role of subsidies in influencing the pattern of trade in goods, is all but meaningless in the digital age, as it becomes steadily more challenging to figure out how much of a product’s value was added in one place and how much in another. The balance of trade, then, has become a useless measure for tracking winners and losers, an idea whose time has come and gone. A country’s success in the Fourth Globalization will depend not on whether the statisticians compute a surplus or a deficit, but on whether its citizens’ living standards rise as they navigate a fast-changing world economy—and whether it ensures that the benefits of a globalized world are shared widely among its citizens.

Public consciousness has not yet assimilated the point that technology is ideology. This, in spite of the fact that before our very eyes technology has altered every aspect of life in America during the past eighty years. For example, it would have been excusable in 1905 for us to be unprepared for the cultural changes the automobile would bring. Who could have suspected then that the automobile would tell us how we were to conduct our social and sexual lives? Would reorient our ideas about what to do with our forests and cities? Would create new ways of expressing our personal identity and social standing? But it is much later in the game now, and ignorance of the score is inexcusable. To be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple. Moreover, we have seen enough by now to know that technological changes in our modes of communication are even more ideology-laden than changes in our modes of transportation. Introduce the alphabet to a culture and you change its cognitive habits, its social relations, its notions of community, history and religion. Introduce the printing press with movable type, and you do the same. Introduce speed-of-light transmission of images and you make a cultural revolution. Without a vote. Without polemics. Without guerrilla resistance.

What is information? Or more precisely, what are information ? What are its various forms? What conceptions of intelligence, wisdom and learning does each form insist upon? What conceptions does each form neglect or mock? What are the main psychic effects of each form? What is the relation between information and reason? What is the kind of information that best facilitates thinking? Is there a moral bias to each information form? What does it mean to say that there is too much information? How would one know?

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

To understand the audience to whom Lincoln and Douglas directed their memorable language, we must remember that these people were the grandsons and granddaughters of the Enlightenment (American version). They were the progeny of Franklin, Jefferson, Madison and Tom Paine, the inheritors of the Empire of Reason, as Henry Steele Commager has called eighteenth-century America. It is true that among their number were frontiersmen, some of whom were barely literate, and immigrants to whom English was still strange. It is also true that by 1858, the photograph and telegraph had been invented, the advance guard of a new epistemology that would put an end to the Empire of Reason. But this would not become evident until the twentieth century. At the time of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, America was in the middle years of its most glorious literary outpouring. In 1858, Edwin Markham was six years old; Mark Twain was twenty-three; Emily Dickinson, twenty-eight; Whitman and James Russell Lowell, thirty-nine; Thoreau, forty-one; Melville, forty-five; Whittier and Longfellow, fifty-one; Hawthorne and Emerson, fifty-four and fifty-five; Poe had died nine years before.

This debate was considerably shorter than those to which the two men were accustomed.

If a sentence refuses to issue forth a fact, a request, a question, an assertion, an explanation, it is nonsense, a mere grammatical shell.

the process encourages rationality; that the sequential, propositional character of the written word fosters what Walter Ong calls the “analytic management of knowledge.” To engage the written word means to follow a line of thought, which requires considerable powers of classifying, inference-making and reasoning. It means to uncover lies, confusions, and overgeneralizations, to detect abuses of logic and common sense. It also means to weigh ideas, to compare and contrast assertions, to connect one generalization to another. To accomplish this, one must achieve a certain distance from the words themselves, which is, in fact, encouraged by the isolated and impersonal text.

The name I give to that period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press is the Age of Exposition. Exposition is a mode of thought, a method of learning, and a means of expression. Almost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, for reasons I am most anxious to explain, the Age of Exposition began to pass, and the early signs of its replacement could be discerned. Its replacement was to be the Age of Show Business.

Americans of the 1800’s were very much concerned with the problem of “conquering” space. By the mid-nineteenth century, the frontier extended to the Pacific Ocean, and a rudimentary railroad system, begun in the 1830’s, had started to move people and merchandise across the continent. But until the 1840’s, information could move only as fast as a human being could carry it; to be precise, only as fast as a train could travel, which, to be even more precise, meant about thirty-five miles per hour. In the face of such a limitation, the development of America as a national community was retarded. In the 1840’s, America was still a composite of regions, each conversing in its own ways, addressing its own interests. A continentwide conversation was not yet possible.

it was an American who found a practical way to put electricity in the service of communication and, in doing so, eliminated the problem of space once and for all. I refer, of course, to Samuel Finley Breese Morse, America’s first true “spaceman.” His telegraph erased state lines, collapsed regions, and, by wrapping the continent in an information grid, created the possibility of a unified American discourse.

For telegraphy did something that Morse did not foresee when he prophesied that telegraphy would make “one neighborhood of the whole country.” It destroyed the prevailing definition of information, and in doing so gave a new meaning to public discourse. Among the few who understood this consequence was Henry David Thoreau, who remarked in Walden that “We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.... We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.”

The telegraph made a three-pronged attack on typography’s definition of discourse, introducing on a large scale irrelevance, impotence, and incoherence. These demons of discourse were aroused by the fact that telegraphy gave a form of legitimacy to the idea of context-free information; that is, to the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision-making and action, but may attach merely to its novelty, interest, and curiosity. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a “thing” that could be bought and sold irrespective of its uses or meaning.

The potential of the telegraph to transform information into a commodity might never have been realized, except for the partnership between the telegraph and the press.

Only four years after Morse opened the nation’s first telegraph line on May 24, 1844, the Associated Press was founded, and news from nowhere, addressed to no one in particular, began to criss-cross the nation. Wars, crimes, crashes, fires, floods—much of it the social and political equivalent of Adelaide’s whooping cough—became the content of what people called “the news of the day.”

Coleridge’s famous line about water everywhere without a drop to drink may serve as a metaphor of a decontextualized information environment: In a sea of information, there was very little of it to use.

How often does it occur that information provided you on morning radio or television, or in the morning newspaper, causes you to alter your plans for the day, or to take some action you would not otherwise have taken, or provides insight into some problem you are required to solve? For most of us, news of the weather will sometimes have such consequences ; for investors, news of the stock market; perhaps an occasional story about a crime will do it, if by chance the crime occurred near where you live or involved someone you know. But most of our daily news is inert, consisting of information that gives us something to talk about but cannot lead to any meaningful action. This fact is the principal legacy of the telegraph: By generating an abundance of irrelevant information, it dramatically altered what may be called the “information-action ratio.”

Books, for example, are an excellent container for the accumulation, quiet scrutiny and organized analysis of information and ideas. It takes time to write a book, and to read one; time to discuss its contents and to make judgments about their merit, including the form of their presentation.

The telegraph introduced a kind of public conversation whose form had startling characteristics: Its language was the language of headlines—sensational, fragmented, impersonal. News took the form of slogans, to be noted with excitement, to be forgotten with dispatch. Its language was also entirely discontinuous. One message had no connection to that which preceded or followed it. Each “headline” stood alone as its own context. The receiver of the news had to provide a meaning if he could. The sender was under no obligation to do so. And because of all this, the world as depicted by the telegraph began to

it has been the custom to speak of photography as a “language.” The metaphor is risky because it tends to obscure the fundamental differences between the two modes of conversation. To begin with, photography is a language that speaks only in particularities. Its vocabulary of images is limited to concrete representation. Unlike words and sentences, the photograph does not present to us an idea or concept about the world, except as we use language itself to convert the image to idea.

Language makes sense only when it is presented as a sequence of propositions. Meaning is distorted when a word or sentence is, as we say, taken out of context; when a reader or listener is deprived of what was said before, and after. But there is no such thing as a photograph taken out of context, for a photograph does not require one. In fact, the point of photography is to isolate images from context, so as to make them visible in a different way.

the photograph was the perfect complement to the flood of telegraphic news-from-nowhere that threatened to submerge readers in a sea of facts from unknown places about strangers with unknown faces. For the photograph gave a concrete reality to the strange-sounding datelines, and attached faces to the unknown names. Thus it provided the illusion, at least, that “the news” had a connection to something within one’s sensory experience. It created an apparent context for the “news of the day.” And the “news of the day” created a context for the photograph.

the photograph provides a context for the sentence you have been given, and that the sentence provides a context of sorts for the photograph, and you may even believe for a day or so that you have learned something. But if the event is entirely self-contained, devoid of any relationship to your past knowledge or future plans, if that is the beginning and end of your encounter with the stranger, then the appearance of context provided by the conjunction of sentence and image is illusory, and so is the impression of meaning attached to it.

It is a world without much coherence or sense; a world that does not ask us, indeed, does not permit us to do anything; a world that is, like the child’s game of peek-a-boo, entirely self-contained.

there is nothing wrong with entertainment. As some psychiatrist once put it, we all build castles in the air. The problems come when we try to live in them. The communications media of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with telegraphy and photography at their center, called the peek-a-boo world into existence, but we did not come to live there until television. Television gave the epistemological biases of the telegraph and the photograph their most potent expression, raising the interplay of image and instancy to an exquisite and dangerous perfection.

In the past few years, we have been learning that the computer is the technology of the future. We are told that our children will fail in school and be left behind in life if they are not “computer literate.” We are told that we cannot run our businesses, or compile our shopping lists, or keep our checkbooks tidy unless we own a computer. Perhaps some of this is true. But the most important fact about computers and what they mean to our lives is that we learn about all of this from television. Television has achieved the status of “meta-medium”—an instrument that directs not only our knowledge of the world, but our knowledge of ways of knowing as well.

When a television show is in process, it is very nearly impermissible to say, “Let me think about that” or “I don’t know” or “What do you mean when you say ... ?” or “From what sources does your information come?” This type of discourse not only slows down the tempo of the show but creates the impression of uncertainty or lack of finish. It tends to reveal people in the act of thinking, which is as disconcerting and boring on television as it is on a Las Vegas stage.

The viewers also know that no matter how grave any fragment of news may appear (for example, on the day I write a Marine Corps general has declared that nuclear war between the United States and Russia is inevitable), it will shortly be followed by a series of commercials that will, in an instant, defuse the import of the news, in fact render it largely banal.

In practice, privatisation now appears to have been overhyped. In many cases, the assets that were privatised were natural monopolies, whose dominant position made them impervious to threat from competitors. Anyone who wants to compete against a privatised railway monopoly may have to invest millions of dollars in new tracks and trains – something likely to deter most new entrants. Selling a monopoly railway might bolster the government’s coffers, but if it pushes up the price of train tickets over coming decades, it’s a crummy deal.

while the five forces are good for profits, they’re bad for consumers. Competition policy typically runs in precisely the opposite direction – towards boosting competition, encouraging new entrants and ensuring that monopolists do not abuse their power in their dealings with suppliers and customers. Short-sighted privatisations – as in the railway example above – often yielded a high initial sale price, but effectively levied a long-term tax on consumers, who ended up paying more to the privatised utility. Economists today tend to be more sceptical of privatisations that could lock in a monopoly provider.

One theory of inequality is that it depends on the relative growth in education and technology.3 If education stagnates while technology advances, society tends to become more unequal. When the level of education grows faster than new technologies emerge, society becomes more equal. The best way of reducing inequality, according to this theory, is by ensuring that everyone gets a great education.

Capital assets such as land and corporate equity tend to be skewed towards the most affluent (the top 10 per cent today own 76 per cent of global wealth), so a high return on capital disproportionately benefits the richest.4 In his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, French economist Thomas Piketty proposed that when r > g, inequality rises. This, he argued, is the normal state of human affairs. In the post-war decades, by contrast, the rate of return on capital in many advanced countries was dramatically below its long-run average, while the rate of economic growth was significantly above its historic average. With r < g, inequality in many high-income countries fell.

In Argentina, economist Raúl Prebisch advocated import substitution industrialisation, in which low-income countries sought to build up a manufacturing sector based around products for which there was substantial domestic demand. While comparative advantage trade theory implies that countries should specialise, import substitution suggests that countries could benefit from creating a diverse manufacturing base. Many advocates of import substitution also supported raising tariffs to discourage imports. This proved to be especially damaging when tariffs were imposed on goods that were themselves used for production, such as arc welders, tractors or office equipment. Import substitution industrialisation did not produce the hoped-for economic gains and would be largely abandoned by the final decades of the twentieth century.

In 1958, Mao launched the ‘Great Leap Forward’, a madcap plan in which farmers were encouraged to produce iron and steel in backyard furnaces. Millions of perfectly good pots and pans were melted into scrap iron. In the same year, Mao demanded that people eliminate sparrows, on the basis that they ate grain. The campaign called on people to make so much noise that the sparrows died of exhaustion. Millions of sparrows died, which meant that they were not around to eat the locusts that devoured much of the following year’s crop. Eventually, Mao imported 250,000 sparrows from the Soviet Union to restore the ecosystem. Crop losses contributed to a 40 per cent drop in rice and wheat output between 1957 and 1961, and a famine that killed tens of millions.17

the United States sent four warships to Japan in 1853, demanding the country end restrictions on trade. The invasion helped end Japan’s shogun era, a seven-century period in which the country was led by military dictators. The last shoguns, the Tokugawa shogunate, curtailed trade, limited diplomatic ties and banned virtually all travel into or out of Japan. The 1867 Meiji restoration, which consolidated power in the hands of the emperor of Japan, began opening Japan to the world. The Meiji government also had a strong emphasis on education, which in turn allowed the country to adopt technology more rapidly. Under the slogan ‘rich country, strong army’, Japan’s modernisers abolished the caste system and allowed people to take any job.5 Samurai warriors – then numbering nearly two million – were replaced by a national army and compulsory military service for all men. Japan’s government prioritised investments in railway and telegraph systems, and adapted Western technologies to account for the fact that labour was cheaper in Japan than it was in Europe and North America.

American polymath Benjamin Franklin once wrote that ‘no nation was ever ruined by trade’. Yet even as they were encouraging other countries to open up, Europe and North America were imposing tariffs on imports. This was partly due to the need for revenue. Before broad-based income taxes, tariffs were a major source of revenue for many nations. Wars such as the Napoleonic Wars and the US Civil War were often funded by an increase in tariffs. Tariffs were easy to administer and good for the government budget, but bad for the economy as a whole. Tariffs have been likened to a country impeding shipping by putting rocks in its own harbours.

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 almost halved the seagoing distance from London to the Arabian Sea. But imperial powers tightly constrained the range of goods exported from their colonies, and managed trade for the benefit of the centre over the periphery. During this era, the economies of Western Europe began to pull away from the rest of the world.

Just as the Dutch and British East India Companies allowed investors to pool risks across multiple seafaring expeditions, so too industrial corporations let financiers share the risk of new ventures in this era. Companies had existed since Roman times, but they proved vital in the case of risky ventures, such as exploring for mineral deposits, building railways into new regions, or selling an exotic product. Corporations also encouraged specialisation, by providing a vehicle through which a rich investor might back the business idea of a penniless entrepreneur. In 1855, the United Kingdom passed the Limited Liability Act, which provided that if a company collapsed, creditors could not recover their debts by pursuing the shareholders personally. Corporations solved the problem of how to get investors to put money into risky ventures: limit the downside so that owners cannot lose more than they invest. But corporations also became large employers, whose bargaining power massively exceeded that of their individual workers. The solution to this problem was the creation of the trade union, in which workers organised to demand better pay and conditions. However, during the early decades of the industrial revolution, unions were illegal.

Alongside the industrial revolution came industrial-scale warfare. From 1861 to 1865, the US Civil War ravaged the country. With the use of mass-produced weapons, railroads, steamships and telegraphs, the Civil War was industrial in its scale, and in its carnage. More than 600,000 combatants – one in five soldiers – lost their lives. At the end of the war, more than three million enslaved people were freed. To economists, one of the striking features of the Civil War is the imbalance in resources between the two sides. A larger population and bigger economy do not guarantee victory (particularly if one side is willing to devote a greater share of its resources to the conflict). But money matters. As the saying goes, God is usually on the side with the bigger battalions. At the outset of the war, the North had a population of 21 million, more than twice the South’s population of 9 million. The South was a primarily agricultural economy, with the North producing 90 per cent of the country’s manufactured goods. Critically, the North produced 97 per cent of the country’s firearms. From an economic standpoint, the notable feature of the war is that the South held out as long as it did. Poor military tactics on the part of the North helped prolong the war, but ultimately the economic disparity between the two regions determined the outcome. During the course of the Civil War, the South funded 60 per cent of its costs through inflation (compared with 13 per cent for the north).11 By the end of the war, the South was printing so much money that goods cost ninety-two times as much as they had done when the conflict began.

This was an era in which nations had been established, but travel across borders was essentially unimpeded. Few people held passports, and going to another country was simply a matter of boarding a train or ship. In 1851, massive gold discoveries in the Australian town of Ballarat caused an influx of migrants. Over the ensuing two decades, Australia’s settler population quadrupled, from 440,000 to 1.7 million.

Analysing creative careers, economist David Galenson has discovered an intriguing pattern.12 Those who do their best work at a younger age tended to be conceptualists, driven by a single breakthrough idea. By contrast, those who produce their masterwork late in life are generally experimentalists, whose work is the gradual product of trial and error. Among artists, Raphael, Johannes Vermeer, Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso were conceptualists, who did their most important work early in their lives. Picasso painted his breakthrough cubist masterpiece Les Demoiselles d’Avignon at age twenty-five. Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Titian and Cézanne were experimentalists, who did their most important work late in

Part of the reason that Australian workers earned more than their British and American counterparts was that employees were scarce. That gave Australian workers more power than northern hemisphere workers. After a strike in 1855, Sydney stonemasons were among the first workers in the world to win the right to an eight-hour day. With plenty of land and few people, Australian wages in the 1880s were the highest in the world, and the Australian labour movement came to play an influential role in politics. In the coming decades, Australia would be among the world’s first countries to allow women to vote and stand for office, set a national minimum wage and hold elections on a Saturday (to maximise voter turnout).

In the 1880s, with the social democrats gaining on him electorally, conservative German chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced into parliament a package of reforms that provided health insurance, accident insurance and an old-age disability pension. The reforms were world-leading for the time, though modest by today’s standards. The ‘sickness funds’ that underpinned Bismarck’s health insurance programs were two-thirds funded by workers. Pensions were paid to those who passed the age of seventy, at a time when average thirty-year-old Germans could only expect to live to their early sixties.13

Parisian homes were quickly connected to the new sewerage system, helping to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases (we might call it ‘the drain gain’). French scientist Louis Pasteur, who had lost three children to typhoid, developed the germ theory of disease and was instrumental in policies to provide cleaner drinking water and isolate infectious patients in hospitals. At the start of the industrial revolution, infectious diseases were a major reason why city-dwellers had higher mortality rates than their country cousins. Far-sighted governments made cities safer, which in turn spurred urbanisation.

As the 1800s drew to a close, some of the world’s fastest-growing cities were in the United States. One reason was that US city planners were more likely to lay out streets in a grid pattern, while many older European cities followed the local topography, or were laid out in a radial pattern. The radial layout made cities easier to defend, but grids are more economically efficient – maximising the use that can be made of street frontage, and making it easier to connect homes to sewerage and transport lines. Chicago is the world’s most gridded city. Rome is one of the least gridded.15 Gridded cities tended to produce the world’s first skyscrapers. By the 1890s, buildings of at least ten storeys could be found in Chicago, New York and St Louis. Two technologies were essential to skyscrapers. The Bessemer process enabled the mass production of steel beams that could hold the weight of the soaring structure. And the passenger elevator allowed people to reach the higher floors. While the technologies were available globally, regulation also influenced where they were constructed. Stricter fire safety and zoning laws constrained the development of skyscrapers in many European cities during the early twentieth century, while US cities gave more freedom to developers. The differences can still be seen in the world’s skylines.

Gladiators were a Roman invention. After the first combat was staged in the forum, which was the very center of Rome, the practice spread and became a defining feature of the Roman Empire. The new show provided the occasion for another Roman invention: the amphitheater, whose primary function was hosting gladiatorial games. The word “amphitheater” means “all-around theater,” because it resembles the shape of two Greek or Roman theaters, which were semicircular, lined up face to face. Like modern stadiums, the typical amphitheater had an oval shape with 360-degree raised seating. This structure became a mark of the Empire and can still be admired in roughly 230 samples not only in Italy, but also in other countries, including Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, England, Cyprus, Croatia, Spain, France, Romania, Greece, and Syria.

Supply and demand, Marshall wrote, were like the blades of a pair of scissors. In a graph with price on one axis and quantity on the other, the line representing supply generally slopes up because more people are willing to provide a good or service when the price is higher. The line representing demand tends to slope down because of the familiar concept of diminishing marginal utility: the more that consumers have of something, the less they are willing to pay for each additional unit. For suppliers, price and quantity increase together. For consumers, there is a negative relationship between price and quantity. In both cases, trade-offs are at play: higher prices cause new suppliers to stop making other things and focus on this one, while higher prices cause some existing buyers to stop consuming this thing in favour of its substitutes. Where the two lines cross is the market equilibrium – the point at which supply meets demand.

The equilibrium price is the price at which the amount that sellers are willing to sell exactly matches the amount that buyers are willing to buy. Earlier economists had graphed supply and demand, but the chart is known as the ‘Marshallian Cross’ because his was the most complete and persuasive description of the model.1 Considering producers, Marshall distinguished between a company’s fixed costs – such as the land and buildings it owns – and its variable costs – such as the labour and raw materials it uses. In the long run, a company will go out of business if it cannot cover the costs of maintaining and replacing its assets. But in the short term, what most affects the price that a company charges for its outputs are its variable costs. The price of cotton will be quickly affected by changes in the cost of water, while the impact of rising machinery costs will be felt more slowly.

As Marshall once summarised his system: ‘(1) Use mathematics as a shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. (2) Keep to them till you have done. (3) Translate into English. (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. (5) Burn the mathematics. (6) If you can’t succeed in 4, burn 3. This last I did often.’ In other words, economists should employ mathematics as a useful tool to illustrate the world – but not get carried away with esoteric mathematics that fails to shed light on how the economy works.

Central banks had existed since the seventeenth century (the Bank of Amsterdam, the central bank of Stockholm and the Bank of England were all founded in the 1600s), but in the twentieth century, central banks increasingly took on the role of providing stability to the economic system. Regular commercial banks use money from short-term deposits to make long-term loans. Because they borrow short and lend long, even the best-managed bank is vulnerable to running out of cash if all its depositors simultaneously demand their money back. By guaranteeing people’s deposits, a central bank can prevent bank runs, and make the financial system more stable. Typically, this doesn’t involve a cent changing hands: once people know that their deposits are guaranteed, the panic is avoided. We might think of financial stability as a public good: a benefit that flows to everyone, undiminished by the number of people who enjoy a more stable system. In the modern era, central banks also have an important role in targeting inflation,

In 1909, Harry Selfridge opened a new kind of department store in Oxford Street, London. Selfridges aimed to make shopping fun. He structured the store so that customers could handle items for sale, encouraged staff to make women shoppers feel welcome and trained them to specialise in different product lines. Selfridge cleverly positioned the perfume counter on the ground floor, invitingly called his customers ‘guests’, and ran ads with the line ‘the customer is always right’.

In the United States, Frank Woolworth created a series of stores that sold products for five and ten cents. These ‘five-and-dime stores’ were said to operate on the principle ‘pile ’em high and sell ’em cheap’.3 In 1912, Woolworth floated on the stock market with 596 stores across the country. With such a large network of stores, they were able to use their buying power to negotiate lower prices with suppliers. Walmart, ÆON, Aldi, Tesco and Carrefour are modern heirs to this retail strategy, which delivers lower prices for consumers and fatter returns for shareholders, while squeezing suppliers and independent retailers.

When economists look at migration, they mostly see people who are relocating to places where they feel safer, happier and more productive. Migrants are not just mouths to feed; they also bring muscles that build and minds that inspire. It is a mistake to see migrants as merely a new source of demand – they are also a new source of supply. World War I broke this interconnected world. War came despite the strong commercial ties between the combatants (in 1914, Lloyd’s of London insured most of the German shipping trade).6 When the nations of Europe sleepwalked into war, much of the world’s trade and migration ceased. And while its origins were unexpected, the ultimate result was not. At the outbreak of hostilities, the Allied powers (Britain, France, Russia and their allies) had far more resources than the Central powers (the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and their allies). The Allied powers had five times the population, eleven times the territory and three times the income.7 The fact that the conflict took four years and claimed around 20 million lives reflects the ineptitude of the generals and the intransigence of the political leaders. But when the conflict ended, the side with the larger economic base had won.

THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE OF WORLD WAR I went well beyond 1918. In the peace settlement, Germany was required to pay reparations of 132 billion gold marks (the sum was expressed in gold reserves). This was equivalent to around half of the country’s pre-war wealth.1 It was a vast amount; beyond anything the German economy could support, and the country’s government struggled to make even the initial payments.2 To meet its debts, the German government began printing money.

At a dinner on 15 October 1929, prominent Yale economist Irving Fisher told his audience that ‘stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau’. But Fisher was wrong. Just over a week later, the market suffered its biggest-ever one-day sell-off: the first of a series of major losses that would become the Great Depression.

Studying the problem of the Great Depression, British economist John Maynard Keynes argued that the problem occurred because people’s actions affected one another in unexpected ways. Keynes likened the problem to a situation in which members of a bee colony decide that they will live thrifty lives. Thrift might seem virtuous, but because one bee’s consumption is another’s production, the colony collapses and all the bees in their hollow tree are left miserable. Keynes argued that the solution was for the government to spend money – ideally on public works projects – to restart the economy.

Hayek saw economic downturns as a necessary evil. He believed that government policies in the pre-crisis period made interest rates too low, which led firms to borrow unwisely. When the crisis came, it was those imprudent firms that collapsed. A recession was less like an avoidable illness and more like the inevitable hangover that follows a drinking binge.4

The Depression also led to a significant slowdown in international capital flows.

Both the supply of foreign investment and the demand for overseas investment dropped. From Vietnam to Brazil, a wave of foreign investment in the first three decades of the century began to peter out in the 1930s.

In 1933, Robinson published The Economics of Imperfect Competition, which flipped economic thinking about the way markets typically operate. Marshall’s models had tended to assume an economy in which markets were composed of many buyers and many sellers. That might be a fine depiction of a few sectors, such as the stock market. But what about the British East India Company? Robinson’s work presented vigorous competition not as the normal state of affairs but as a special case. Where others imagined a dynamic marketplace with lots of traders, Robinson’s analysis recognised that monopolies and oligopolies were common.

Robinson also introduced the concept of monopsony: the situation in which a seller has pricing power over its suppliers. In a one-company town, the employer has monopsony power over workers, allowing it to pay them less than their true value. If a supermarket chain controls most of the grocery sector, it can exert monopsony power over farmers, paying them less than they would receive in a competitive market.

Alexander dubbed the law ‘the Negro Reduction Act’. To achieve racial equality, Alexander argued, full employment was essential. Because Black workers were ‘the last to be hired and the first to be fired’, they suffered most in an economic slump. Full employment also improved racial attitudes. Alexander argued that full employment strengthened democracy by ameliorating white workers’ ‘fears of economic rivalry’. In a strong labour market, Alexander contended, political demagogues were less likely to find a foothold. She was ahead of her time: recent research shows that economic crises raise the odds that right-wing populists win office.

The 1938 Munich Agreement allowed Germany to annexe the Sudetenland. The 1939 Nazi–Soviet Pact facilitated Germany’s invasion of Eastern Europe. Economic factors mattered too. Japan’s imperial ambitions were partly a product of its lack of domestic energy reserves. Hyperinflation and the burden of World War I reparations caused resentment among many Germans. Germany’s invasion of Russia represented an attempt to gain control of additional oil reserves in the region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.1

Compared with the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan and their allies), the Allied powers (the United Kingdom, France and their allies) had more than twice as many people, more than seven times as much territory, and a combined income that was 40 per cent higher.

Germany’s early victories owed much to the skill of generals such as Erwin Rommel, and tactics such as blitzkrieg (lightning war) and bewegungskrieg (manoeuvre warfare). As one economic historian puts it, ‘Everybody – the Poles, the Dutch, the Belgians, the French, the Yugoslavs, the Greeks, the British, the Americans, and the Russians – who faced the Nazis failed more or less equally, both tactically and operationally, at least in their initial encounters, and in no small number of subsequent encounters.’

Yet there were no decisive battles in World War II.4 Not Pearl Harbor. Not Midway. Not Stalingrad. Not Kursk. The war was primarily a contest of industrial production, and the Allied powers had more resources at their disposal. This was true even midway through the war, because while Hitler’s Germany had annexed much of Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union had joined the conflict on the side of the Allies. In 1942, the Allied powers still retained a decisive advantage in people, territory and income. Aircraft carriers illustrate the differential: although Japan grasped their strategic value early, the Allied powers built nine-tenths of the carriers produced during the war. The combatant nations differed in how much of their economy they devoted to the war effort.5 Italy never devoted more than one-quarter of its economy to World War II, while at its peak Japan was devoting more than three-quarters of its economy to the military. The United Kingdom and Russia also managed to deliver more than half of their output to the war, while the United States devoted two-fifths of its economy to the war. Put together, this gave a substantial advantage to the Allied powers. When it came to the production of munitions, the Allied powers produced at least twice as many rifles, tanks, aircraft, mortars and warships. The Axis powers were literally outgunned.

World War II saw squadrons of bombers devastate cities with incendiary – and ultimately atomic – bombs. On the oceans, World War II featured aircraft carriers, enabling naval battles in which the opposing ships never saw one another. Long-range bombers, jet fighters, self-guiding torpedoes and cruise missiles all emerged from World War II. All up, World War II claimed three times as many lives as World War I had done.

World War II brought advances in econometrics – the application of statistical techniques to economic questions. One practical concern was how best to reinforce bombers to increase their chances of surviving enemy fire. Naive colleagues had looked at the underside of returning aircraft and, seeing disproportionate damage to places like the tail, had suggested reinforcing those spots. But mathematician Abraham Wald, a Jewish refugee from Hungary, recognised that they were only seeing part of the picture. What they saw was the damage that a bomber could sustain and still return home. The absence of returning bombers with nose damage suggested that it was precisely spots like this that required additional reinforcement.

Specialisation between societies is the basis of trade. If a society realises that it does not have comparative advantage it would start indulging in a trade war which is protectionism.
the US in 2025 is doing exactly this driven by fears of being overrun in services competion from China

Content is anything that can be consumed by an audience via a platform. Content is stuff where the primary purpose is to draw an audience to feed them advertising. Lots of content on the internet is writing, but there is also content made of words that does not qualify as writing. The meaning, purpose, and quality of the content is immaterial, provided it can be monetized through clicks. There is no genuine communicative intent behind content.

things that have occurred, and if they hadn’t occurred, then we would not be here to ask the question. The anthropic principle says it’s therefore a bit pointless to even discuss the probability of our existence. It’s an extreme example of ‘survivorship bias’ – books at airports are full of tips about what made successful businesses, but it is impossible to identify factors that increase your chances by only looking at successes – we need to compare them with failures. Similarly, to answer these sorts of existential questions, we would need to consider situations in which we did not exist. Which we don’t have access to,

In some circumstances it can make sense to assess probabilities for events that occurred, such as when someone has won a lottery or had three children with the same birthdays, since it is just about imaginable that we might do this before the event. But nobody would conceivably have thought of me existing before I did, and to assess probabilities about humanity or the universe requires us to think of either an alien species or something outside our universe. Which doesn’t seem to make much practical sense, so that’s why I don’t have to try to answer these questions.

Bringing uncertainty into deep learning is an active area of research, and uncertainty quantification is an integral part of machine learning in general, and so maybe things will improve and future AI will be able to provide a reliable assessment of its (personal) uncertainty.

Once we accept that probabilities are essentially judgements, it is natural to take a Bayesian approach to learning from experience, in which our probabilities are updated by accumulating evidence, and Bayes’ theorem shows how probability can be used to counter claims that events must have been ‘more than a coincidence’. Our brains appear to work in a Bayesian way, with strong prior expectations being updated in the light of observations, but Oliver Cromwell has taught us that we need to keep a small amount of doubt about our understanding of the world so that we can accept and adapt to surprising events.

formal statistical models are useful, but we should not be deluded into thinking they represent reality. Calculated measures such as P-values and confidence intervals are conditional on all the assumptions of the model being true, which we know is not the case, and so the outputs from statistical packages must always be treated with caution and as rough guides. Claims based on models need sensitivity analysis, recognition of their limitations, and summaries of the quality of the underlying evidence, and preferably assessments of confidence in the whole analysis. Models can be valuable in giving an idea of who, or what, was to blame for bad things that have happened.

we should endeavour to express our uncertainty through numbers wherever possible. The theory of probability is a remarkable framework with many extraordinary properties, helping us to understand both why coincidences happen so often, and the role of luck in our lives. We can, in principle, claim any probabilities we want, but if we want them to be useful then they need to fit the real world, by being both calibrated and discriminatory.

Such as winning the lottery, surviving a First World War infantry attack, or Bill and Alan driving home. Circumstantial luck, in which the vital factor deciding the outcome is being in the right place at the right time, or in the wrong place at the wrong time – such as in a plane about to crash.

Consider the simple task of throwing a die until you get a six. How many throws will you need? We can assume each throw is independent, and the die is nicely symmetric, and so if I have thrown the die without success so far, the probability of getting a six on the next throw is 1⁄6. So what is the probability that I will get my first six on, say, the third throw? This means I did not get a six on the first two throws (which has probability 5⁄6 × 5⁄6) but then I do get a six on the third throw (with probability 1⁄6) so the total probability is 5⁄6 × 5⁄6 × 1⁄6 = 25⁄216 = 0.12.

This is known as a geometric distribution.fn4 The mean average of the distribution in Figure 5.1 is 6, so that if I want to throw a six, on average I will take 6 throws, and if I want to throw 100 sixes, I can expect to take 600 throws. The useful general rule is that if we are trying to achieve something, with a chance p of succeeding at each independent attempt, then on average we will need 1⁄p attempts to achieve it, although there is 37% chance that we will need more.fn5 The median of the distribution is 4, since in 51% of attempts, I will need 4 or fewer throws to get a six – this perhaps can be thought of as the ‘typical’ number of throws needed. The mode of the distribution – the most likely throw to get the first six – is the very first throw. This can seem rather unintuitive, but with a constant chance of occurring at each attempt, the most likely time for the next event is straight away. This can help explain why apparently random events tend to cluster, as we saw in Chapter 4. If unconnected rare occurrences, such as radioactive decay or (most) plane crashes, have a constant chance of happening in each unit of time, then the gaps between them will have an exponential distribution. There is no force that will encourage them to be equally spaced – after a plane crash, the most likely time for the next one is immediately.

Even if we do not believe in some mystical process that will bring us good fortune, can we improve our chances of events turning in our favour? The first step must be to improve our knowledge and skills, following the dictum (generally attributed to golfer Gary Player) that ‘The more you practise, the luckier you get.’ Apart from this obvious tactic, psychologist Richard Wiseman has concluded that so-called ‘lucky’ people tend to follow four basic principles.23 They spot and take advantage of any opportunities they encounter. They have good intuition about appropriate actions. They have positive expectations, giving them confidence to act. They have the resilience to deal with adverse events and turn them to their advantage.

my personal feeling is that luck is not some mystical force – that your real luck happens when you are born, and after that it’s a matter of making the best of the hand you’ve been dealt in the face of uncontrollable outside events.

uncertainty is a relationship between someone (perhaps ‘you’) and the outside world, so it depends on the subjective perspective and knowledge of the observer. Our personal judgements therefore play an essential role whenever we are faced with uncertainty, whether we are thinking about our lives, weighing up what people tell us, or doing scientific research. Again, tolerance of uncertainty can vary hugely between people – some might get a sense of excitement from unpredictability, while others feel chronic anxiety.

If we want a firmer grip on uncertainty, we need to start using numbers, and a first step is to try to define what we mean by words such as likely. A simple quiz can then show that not only can we put our ignorance into numbers, but also score how good our judgements are – and see how super-forecasters think.

We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know. — United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2002 This was widely ridiculed at the time, but has since been accepted as an important contribution to the language of not-knowing.

Now try to remember – what were you doing exactly 1 day ago, 1 year ago, 10 years ago? This is rather different from trying to look into the future.

After Fidel Castro’s revolutionaries took power in Cuba in 1959, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plotted with Cuban exiles to overthrow the new regime and restore a US-friendly government. By the time President Kennedy was inaugurated in January 1961, plans were well advanced, but when the US Joint Chiefs of Staff evaluated the proposal for an invasion, they were somewhat sceptical and reckoned it had only around 30% probability of success. When Brigadier General David Gray drafted a report for President Kennedy, he translated this number into ‘a fair chance’, by which he meant ‘not too good’. But Kennedy apparently interpreted ‘a fair chance’ as meaning the odds were reasonable, and later gave his support to the invasion.1 On 17 April 1961, the 1,500 Cuban exiles who landed at the Bay of Pigs on the south coast of Cuba were met with strong resistance, led by Fidel Castro himself – over a hundred were killed and most of the rest captured. The operation was a complete fiasco, a massive embarrassment to the US, and led to Cuba being drawn closer to Russia – the subsequent missile crisis of 1962 came perilously close to a nuclear confrontation.

holding building area constant, if we compare two buildings, but one is 10 percent higher than the other, it produces 1.3 percent more GHGs, on average. This means that taller buildings do generate more GHGs but also do so at a decreasing rate. Adding one floor to a ten-story building adds 1.3 percent more GHGs, but adding one floor to a one-hundred-story building only adds 0.13 percent GHGs, on average. If the same number of people occupy each floor, then on a per capita basis, more height reduces per capita GHG emissions. But I also find a larger role from the building area. Take two buildings that are the same height, but one is 10 percent larger; the second one will produce about 6 percent more GHGs. Bulk is thus worse than height.

Studies in Hong Kong showed that for tall buildings about half of the energy usage was for heating and cooling, 15 percent for lighting, and another 6 percent for elevators. But what is it about building height, per se, that affects energy usage? First is the nature of its façade. Tall buildings are more exposed to the sun and elements. The greater the surface area relative to the volume, the greater its “interaction” with the environment, particularly when glass is involved. Before World War II most structures were clad in masonry and “punched” with windows. The reliance on masonry curtain walls actually provided a benefit for energy usage: the stone or brick walls added a cave-like property—keeping the building cooler from the sun in the summer and warmer from the cold in the winter. But after World War II, the triumph of the glass box also meant a corresponding ratcheting up in energy usage. Whereas tall buildings completed prior to the war had between 20 and 40 percent glazing, postwar Modernist “International Style” buildings had between 50 and 70 percent glazing. They also tended to use fixed single-glazed panels, which had poor thermal and insulating properties. Without air-conditioning, the glass box could never have been built.

That means one tower could hold thirty thousand people. A city of 9 million (about the same as New York, London, or Hong Kong) could be housed in a mere three hundred buildings. If each one had a base of 80,000 square feet (1.83 acres), the entire population of this future city would only require 551 acres (223 hectares), less area than New York’s Central Park or the City of London.

The engineering knowledge to create a one-mile structure and to elevator it is here. The real problems are the economics and the needed technologies to cater to new issues that arise from the building being so tall. With current structural designs, the building will need to have several million square feet to generate the revenues to make it work. The Jeddah Tower, very thin by today’s standards, will have 2.6 million usable square feet (243,866 km2) of floor area. Extruding this tower to one mile high would mean not only that its height is increased by 60 percent, but also its floor area will nearly quintuple. The “best” one-mile-high tower using today’s know-how will have 12 million square feet—like Wright’s tower. If the Twin Towers—with a total of 10 million square feet—showed anything two decades ago, it was that putting that kind of square footage on the market will drive down prices for the foreseeable future. Good for buyers and renters, but lousy for the overall investment prospects. This price effect, however, could be mitigated in part by opening the building in stages, with the lower floors and the observation decks opening first and then the rest to follow as the demand warrants.

The mechanical floors have no glass windows to reduce vortex shedding. “It’s similar to making holes in the sail of a boat,” explains Silvian Marcus, the lead engineer for the structure. “Instead of making the building even stiffer to overcome the movement, we flow with the wind.” On the demand side is the rise of the global class of billionaires who seek to park their savings and have a pied-à-terre in one of the world’s greatest cities. Since the resident population is low, fewer elevators are needed, allowing the core to be that much smaller and apartments that much bigger. The use of interlocking “switchback” stairwells allows two staircases to be provided in the same space, helping to shrink the core that much more.

Building medium- or high-rise housing for the middle classes need not be so pricey. When it comes to middle-class housing, there is no universal building height that minimizes the average construction costs, as much depends on local conditions. In some relatively less regulated countries with a fast-moving construction sector and low labor costs, taller buildings can be built more cheaply. Also, much depends on the sizes of available lots. It’s much more efficient to lay out whole communities. Ten tall buildings on one large lot can be cheaper on a per-unit basis than ten smaller buildings on ten lots.

Each must not only make up for the perceived architectural mistakes of the past but also provide the great architecture that the former-imperial-now-global city deserves.

The Qatari investment, however, fuels the perception that superluxury skyscrapers in the West are funded largely by Arabian sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), but this is not quite true. SWFs are reluctant to jump directly into development because of the risks involved in investing in cities with different cultures and laws. Rather, SWFs tend to build real estate closer to home, where it’s easier to manage their projects. The Qatari investment in the Shard is an example that shows that international backers tend to invest after a local developer has done much of the groundwork. Given how large the pool of global capital is, local developers are constantly courting investors from the world over. And with planning permission in hand and glossy renderings, these local developers can entice foreign investors to get a piece of the action.

Belief, whether ancient faiths or modern ideologies, has a plastic quality. Where warfare results, it is often short term, a result of heightened enthusiasm whose force ebbs away after the first spasms of violence: the conquered may well abandon one faith and adopt another; belief can be abandoned or scaled down if the gods seem not to favor the warriors fighting in their name; modern ideology can be shed remarkably quickly, as National Socialism was in Germany after 1945 or Leninism-Marxism after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Human societies in the past have all displayed some form of cosmological explanation, and many still do.

the First Crusade, launched by Pope Urban II in his sermon at Clermont. The pope had his own motives as one of the eleventh-century church reformers: he was trying to end warfare between ostensibly Christian princes in Europe and to direct their energies against the enemies, pagan and Muslim, that threatened the survival of the Christian world. His predecessor, Gregory VII, even hoped that intervention in the Muslim east might result in Rome exercising spiritual leadership over the whole Christian world, Orthodox Byzantium included. Preaching crusade was consonant with a broader desire to confirm church authority and reinvigorate a Christian tradition of sacred warfare.

It is a fundamental paradox that Christianity was founded on the pacifist injunction to love your neighbor and renounce violence, but after the first few centuries came to endorse warlike defense of the faith. The holy warrior, armed and armored for God’s purpose, became a central figure in medieval Christian culture and can be seen still in numerous effigies and windows in Europe’s Christian churches. The link between Christian faith and warfare emerged with the fourth-century conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity under Emperor Constantine. Although war was still formally regarded as sinful, if it was waged in a just cause—in this case defense of the faith against pagans and heretics—it was no longer tainted. Saint Augustine, writing in the wake of the Roman conversion, claimed that the biblical commandment that forbade killing “was not broken by those who have waged war on the authority of God.”

Christian warriors, however brutal or worldly in fact, could become saints and martyrs for the faith and heroized as such, like the East Anglian king Edmund, killed in war with the Vikings in ninth-century England and soon canonized. Through the Carolingian empire of the eighth and ninth centuries, sacred warfare was waged to defend and expand Christian Europe. Warriors for Christ, according to the ninth-century pope John VIII, won remission of all sin for “the defense of Christendom.”13 Over the next 200 years, Christianity fought against major threats from pagans in the north and east of Europe and the Muslim invasion of Mediterranean Spain and France, but only during the period of church reform in the mid-eleventh century did the concept of “holy war” become a central church ambition.

The object was to free the Holy Places in Palestine from control of the “Saracens,” the general term used to describe the mix of Arabs and Seljuk Turks occupying the Near East. Muslim Arabs had captured Jerusalem in 638 CE and turned it into a holy city of Islam. In 1009, the Muslim caliph of Cairo ordered the destruction of the church of the Holy Sepulchre. For Christians, the city was the site of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection; there were eschatological writings that suggested Jerusalem would be the site of the Last Days predicted in the biblical Book of Revelation. The capture of the city was expected to be a moment of transformation.

The perseverance of the First Crusade says much for its intended religious cause, as there was no other obvious reason to be struggling far from home across hostile desert and hills with high casualties and at considerable personal cost. Jerusalem was finally reached in June 1099, and after a brief siege it was captured. The crusaders, who had been subjected to years of propaganda about the coming of Antichrist in the city, systematically massacred the Muslim population, burned to death the Jews of Jerusalem in the main synagogue, and tortured Eastern Christians into revealing the whereabouts of what was left of the True Cross on which Jesus was crucified.17 The crusaders sent back or returned with sacred relics and many souvenir pieces of the True Cross. The stories of their exploits were expressed in letters and sermons.

Any history of the religious character of the wars waged to expel the crusaders from their new kingdoms in Antioch, Edessa, Jerusalem, and Tripoli on the Syrian coast must begin decades after the crusaders had achieved the papal goal. But like the Crusades, Muslim warfare eventually came to focus on waging war in the cause of Allah to recover Jerusalem, a symbol of the religious contest between the two sides. There was much less difficulty in reconciling religion and warfare in Islam, as the establishment of Muslim territory relied from the outset upon the willingness of Muslims collectively to defend and enlarge the faith.

The term used to describe defense of the faith is jihād, “to strive/make effort in the way of Allah,” but the meaning depends on the context. The “greater jihād” means personal inner struggle to become a better Muslim; the “lesser jihād” is struggle against non-Muslims and is a collective obligation on the faithful to defend the “House of Islam” (Dar al-Islam) against the “House of War” (Dar al-Harb). The spread of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain over the next two centuries was based on this lesser jihād.21 War to defend the faith was waged on the frontiers of pagan central Asia and the Byzantine Empire and against Christians in southwest Europe. It could be declared only by established authority, either political (the caliphs) or religious (the imams). Like

The religious leaders of Islam, like the popes of eleventh-century Europe, blamed the failure to wage war for the faith on a lack of piety and true religion. The concept revived only under two Turkish leaders, Imad al-Ding Zengi and his son Nūr al-Din. Zengi recaptured the first of the crusaders’ new kingdoms, Edessa, in 1144. His son spent much of the time fighting other Muslims in order to unify the Near East, but Nūr al-Din forged a close alliance with Muslim clerics to cleanse Islam and revive its mission, and he eventually became an ascetic model for other Muslim leaders. The symbolic ambition was to take back Jerusalem, which was the third holy city in Islam after Mecca and Medina, the site of Muhammad’s “journey into the heavens” and of the sacred al-Aqsā mosque; as in the Christian tradition, Jerusalem was also central to Muslim eschatology, the place where the resurrection and the “Last Day” would happen. By the 1160s, the Islamic tradition of the “merits of Jerusalem” was revived as propaganda for its reconquest. Nūr al-Din died before he could lead the jihād to take back the city, but his adopted follower, the Kurdish leader Salah al-Din (Saladin), committed himself to wage war for the faith and retook the city in October 1187 following the decisive battle of Hittīn. His son recalled that before the battle, Saladin had declared “Satan must not win!” A sermon subsequently preached in the restored al-Aqsā mosque invoked Allah as the source of victory and Saladin’s forces as the army of Allah.24 By the time the crusaders were finally expelled, with the fall of the port of Acre in 1291, militant jihād, in the words of the jurist Ibn Taymīyah, produced either “victory and triumph or martyrdom and paradise.”

These were religious ages in which politics, social structure, and religion were elements of a common worldview. What makes the wars of religion different from other late medieval conflicts is simply that in this case, belief predominated as the motivator of violence. They were wars, or in most cases civil wars, fought because the enemy was defined in terms of religious beliefs, practices, and affiliation.

Historians of the English Civil War, in this case too, have come to take the religious dimension of the origins and course of the civil war as the missing link in explaining the descent into armed conflict. Puritan iconoclasts took seriously the beliefs that led them to civil war in 1642 to protect England from a conspiracy to reintroduce “popery” and undermine their branch of reformed, Calvinist Christianity, even when the constitutional issues seemed close to resolution. There were also mainstream Protestants who doubted the king’s willingness to defend what the Declaration of Lords and Commons in August 1642 called the “true religion.”34

The role of belief from the Crusades to the English Civil War was to privilege it over temporal ambition. In all these cases, war resulted from the desire to reform or purify existing religious belief; sin, Satan, and salvation were common tropes in conflicts with a powerful eschatological core. Jerusalem’s population would not have been massacred, nor confessional dissenters burnt at the stake, nor religious communities butchered, if belief were not a driving force behind the carnage.

It is difficult to see in these beliefs simply an elite strategy to maintain social power and political domination of the empire, though this is still a current interpretation, perhaps because it makes the gory spectacle of mass sacrifice somehow more comprehensible in modern terms.

In the twentieth century, movements that developed in Europe in the years after the First World War were committed to an ideology of social reconstruction and rigid political conformity. Communism, Fascism, and National Socialism have come to be regarded, in a term coined by the Italian historian Emilio Gentile, as “political religions,” which are as demanding of their members as any puritanical church.57 They have been bracketed together as totalitarian movements, bent on controlling every aspect of the lives of their people. These were experimental systems whose symbols, myths, and rituals mimicked those of religion; they made a distinction between true believers and heretics that justified in the eyes of the ruling elite a reign of terror against the unbelievers. In the Soviet Union, the trial of those defined as heretics (“enemies of the people”) resembled medieval practice, first torture followed by forced confessions of heresy, followed by execution. In Hitler’s Germany, the religiosity of the regime was expressed in the taking of oaths to a worldly savior or suffering exclusion from the racial congregation. Even the title chosen by Hitler, the Führer, suggested a guide or prophet, leading the German people to a future promised land of racial empire, purified of those who polluted the racial body—Jews, the so-called asocials, and Roma “half-breeds.” The earthly paradises promised by the political religions were certainly not the same, but like the major monotheistic religions, there was a necessary shared belief, a political faith in the achievement of a communist utopia or a pure “people’s community,” an end point in time, or “eschaton,” when the world would be made anew.

the Cold War from the 1940s to the 1980s was defined as much by hostility to communist ideology in the West as it was by any Soviet threat to wage war for further converts. In the post–Cold War era, American commitment to a core internationalist ideology, reflecting American national interests, persisted. President George W. Bush in his State of the Union address in 2006 claimed that the United States had been summoned by God and by history to “end tyranny in our world.” This commitment has resulted in a permanent readiness for war in which ideology remains a central feature in the pursuit of American strategic and material interests.

One of the consequences of the persistence of Western violence has been the emergence of a radical return to the politics of jihād in defense of a puritan version of Islam, long suppressed through the experience of European colonialism and the pressure on traditional religion in the face of secular modernization. This is by no means a recent phenomenon: Islamic militancy in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has strong continuities with the distant past of Islamic legal and religious life and with the response of Islam to the establishment of colonial empires by Christian powers. The desire to create a purified religion, common to most modern jihād movements, has echoes of the response to the Crusades and draws heavily on the eighteenth-century Wahhabist movement, led by the Arab cleric Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, for a reformation of Islamic faith. Modern reformers look to the “pious forefathers” (Salaf al-Sālihïn) as a reference point for their renovation of the Muslim world.67 In imitation of the efforts of Nūr al-Din to mobilize Muslim religious fervor to confront the crusading Christians, the modern leaders of radical Islam appeal to the language of the medieval struggle to justify their jihādist movements, “fighting in the way of God.” The Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini saw in the conflict with the West “the last stage of the historical crusades”; one of the founders of modern Islamic resistance in the 1950s, Sayyid Qutb, invoked jihād “against the crusader spirit which runs in the blood of all Westerners.” The journal of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) repeatedly invoked the fight against “the crusader coalition” and hoped to rescue Muslims unfortunate enough to be living “amongst the crusaders.”68 The revival of the ancient tradition of jihād dates back to at least the 1950s and 1960s with the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the broader Muslim hostility to the new state of Israel and its Western supporters. But not until the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the successful Iranian revolution the same year did the call to defense of the faith become more widespread, and in many cases more strident. The summons of the mujahidin from all over the Muslim world to fight against Soviet efforts to undermine Afghani Islam was the first real manifestation of modern jihād. This practical violence was supported by Islamic clerics and jurists who returned to ancient texts to justify the violence and explain its purpose. The 1984 fatwā of Aballah Yūsuf Azzām, “In Defense of Muslim Lands,” was

the failure of Muslim governments and leaders to defend a pure version of the faith permitted war against the apostates of Islam as well as the idolators and polytheists of the modernizing West. One theological response in Islam is to declare apostates, particularly rulers who “rule by other than God’s laws,” as subject to takfir, or “declaration of infidelity.” Rulers who pretend to be Muslim will incur the wrath of God as much as the infidels who invade Muslim land.70 This explains why much of the current wave of Islamic war is waged against other Muslims as well as the “polytheistic and idolatrous” enemy in the West. Because modern jihād can be waged without authorization from above, the number of groups fighting for a purer Islam has proliferated:

Social science generally assumes that those who gravitate to radical Islamic groups do so because they are the victims of Western globalization, which leaves them impoverished, marginalized, and resentful (as many indeed are), or because they need a distinct identity in order to challenge the threat posed by violent Western intervention, or because they are attracted by the familiar ideology of Muslim political insurgency. The temptation is to see movements that claim to be based on a historic defense of Islam as sham religiosity, to be exposed by the “real” motives of those who take part as social and political actors. These are interpretations hard to reconcile with the aims and (extreme) actions of those groups that have declared jihād, unless all belief is to be dismissed as so much expedient rhetoric rather than an essential explanation for behavior that is otherwise difficult to understand once the religious imperatives are played down or ignored.

The idea of war against unbelievers and apostates reached its apogee with the founding of al-Qaida and then with ISIS. Both are puritanical movements committed to the reconquest of former Muslim lands and the imposition of Shari’a law. Both are Sunni Muslim, which pits them against Shi’ite Muslims as well as the world of “crusaders” and their apostate Muslim allies, although Shi’ite jihādists also began their own version of religious war in the wake of the first Persian Gulf conflict.

ISIS has pursued a form of Islamic puritanism derived from readings of the Qur’an and the hadith. As in all the religious wars described above, ISIS supporters saw themselves as true believers. They also shared an apocalyptic vision of the clash between the Islamic state and the world of infidels and apostates that mirrored the eschatological imagination from the Crusades to the English Civil War. ISIS established a caliphate, revived what it saw as a conquest society initiated by Muhammad, and campaigned for all Muslims to struggle for a global “Abode of Islam.” Its members believed that the final battle foretold in the Qur’an would take place at the small Syrian village of Dabiq, recorded in the hadith, and named the ISIS mouthpiece journal after it. During the final apocalyptic struggle with the forces of Satan, both Jesus and the Mahdi (“messianic guide”) were to appear to help defeat the infidel enemy and all Muslim heretics.75 The end times would be revealed only by God, when jihād would be replaced, as the Qur’an explained, by qitāl, a state of true war.

In all these cases, from the Crusades to ISIS, much of the scholarly analysis of their causes has rested on another belief: that humans do not really go to war for religion or ideology or the supernatural but for reasons comprehensible to the modern Western view of human behavior, driven by material interests, political ambitions, or social protest.

Few wars in the modern age were so blatantly about seizing resources—land, minerals, oil, among others—than the German invasion of the Soviet Union launched on June 22, 1941. In a meeting with senior commanders on January 9, 1941, Hitler gleefully reminded them of the “immeasurable riches” that conquest of the Soviet area would bring.2 In this he was consistent with views he had held since at least the late 1920s. In the “Second Book,” in which he explained the ecological necessity for living space, he concluded that “this space can only lie in the East.”3 The empire he planned to build in Russia was an empire of exploitation that would use the Slav population as so many helots while the German rulers sent back to the German people a stream of resources as befitted an imperial people.

Ecological conflict involves natural resources essential to sustain life in a particular environment, and it emerges when a scarce but vital resource is controlled by others, thus limiting favorable access; or when resources once abundant have been reduced by overhunting or climate change; or when a population surge eats up the necessary resources, which must be found elsewhere. But in cases where resource stress is less obvious, the battle for resources, like Hitler’s invasion, is designed to bolster imperial, or national, or tribal power at the expense of others.

Stalin understood the economic and political crisis of the 1930s as “a general crisis of capitalism” and assumed that “things are heading towards a new imperialist war,” consistent with Lenin’s view in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism (published during the First World War) that capitalist imperialism explained the origin of modern conflict.5 The Marxist-Leninist argument that the causes of modern war could be found in the material motives of an economic system that searches for resources to exploit, markets to dominate, capital gains to be made, and territory to conquer became an orthodoxy of the political Left worldwide by the mid-twentieth century and has remained an active explanation ever since. Peace, so it has been argued, was only possible once the proletariat or its political vanguard had replaced the bourgeois state with a socialist alternative in which resources were shared rather than accumulated by the rich. The Marxist interpretation of the reasons for war owed little directly to Marx, who, like his contemporary Darwin, was little interested in war as such. His focus was on historical materialism, explaining the long-term development of forms of class struggle in the different economic ages of human history, first the classical slave economies, then feudalism, and finally bourgeois capitalism. “Is

after Lenin, economic predation as the cause of war was taken for granted. “Remember the imperialist war” was the first appeal to the European working class by the newly founded Communist International in 1919. At the international’s Seventh World Congress in August 1935, the Italian communist Ercole Ercoli (the political alias of Palmiro Togliatti) gave a long speech analyzing the communist explanation for why wars occur. The concentration of capital into huge trusts and corporations sharpened the struggle to control markets and resources through imperial conquest. The crisis caused by the contest between rival capitalist blocs, Ercoli continued, prompted the most reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie to accept that war was at certain times the “best means,” sometimes “the only means,” to overcome it.7 Most Marxists assumed that war was as a result inevitable.

Marxist analysis has been used to explain wars in the ancient world to secure slaves to service the classical economy, which was dominated by an exploitative landowning and urban elite. There are Marxist accounts of the Aztec seizure of war captives for mass sacrifice as an instrument to demonstrate the power of the ruling class.10 Marxism can be used to explain why the feudal ruling class engaged in persistent conflict to seize land and the serfs needed to work it. Later, early capitalism, as it transcended the feudal age, used violence to control overseas resources against competitors and to crush indigenous resistance in the territories exploited globally by Europe’s rich merchant class. There are Marxist explanations for the outbreak of civil wars, where economic class interests clashed, as they did in the American Civil War between rival capitalists or later in the postrevolutionary civil war in Russia between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

After 1945, the official Marxist-Leninist line continued to insist that there existed a general crisis of capitalism, “a decaying and moribund” system, whose growing aggressiveness in Korea or Vietnam was driven by the most extreme imperialist wing of monopoly capital, whose militaristic strivings were “incessantly growing.”12 The more evident the crisis was, the more capitalists, above all those in the United States, pressured governments to spend heavily on the military and pursue an aggressive foreign policy. The wars in the Persian Gulf were the result, according to two neo-Marxist economists, Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan, of the power of “dominant capital,” the “Weapondollar-petrodollar Coalition” (the biggest arms and oil corporations), to pressure the White House into accepting conflict so that the corporations’ profits would rise in step with the onset of war, as indeed they did.13 For modern Marxists, the contradictions in a failing economic order once again have provoked war and will do so again. “Capitalism does not go to war for its own sake,” wrote the organizer of the Committee for a Workers’ International in 2006, “but to conquer markets, increase its income.”

Communist, or more precisely Soviet, ideology on the relationship between war and capitalist imperialism is widely regarded as theoretically flawed, too prescriptive and one-dimensional to be convincing; to continue to argue the case that wars are always the result of “the basic economic sources” is also empirically problematic. Capitalism, for all its current issues, has not demonstrated a general crisis leading to its collapse in war, any more than was the case between 1939 and 1945. The argument that the dominant class in different economic systems fights wars to seize additional resources has an obvious plausibility, but it suggests an economic determinism that not only undermines any idea of human agency but is also difficult to demonstrate historically except in prescriptive terms too general to be useful. Nor can it account satisfactorily for warfare before the onset of the state, when resources might be seized by communities that were egalitarian rather than based on distinct social classes.

The era of “monopoly capitalism” is perhaps the most problematic for the Marxist interpretation, because the burden of proof that specific wars were engineered by big business has proved persistently difficult to find, despite the presence of powerful industrial and financial organizations dedicated to military production and research. It was not the armaments barons who pushed Europe into war in 1914. Hitler’s later invasion of the Soviet Union was driven by a radical nationalist agenda, not capitalist ambition; Germany’s major business leaders, though they might hope to profit from victory, did not force Hitler’s hand. The argument that the “Weapondollar-petrodollar Coalition” conspired to provoke the Second Gulf War can only be inferred, not proved. In the end, military production, from flint arrowheads to machine guns, makes wars possible by encouraging use of the weapons produced, but it is state and non-state actors who over the long historical past have decided when and for what reason the weapons will be used. The suggestion that capitalists have only hesitated to press for nuclear war because they know it will destroy their markets and kill their customers is unconvincing: they want to avoid nuclear war for reasons that are obvious.

That there can be economic motives at work in the predatory aspiration to seize or exploit resources through war is an unexceptional argument. There have been few conflicts in which resources have not been appropriated by the victor at some stage, even if taking resources was not the proximate or principal cause but a consequence of victory. For humans before the Holocene, fighting for resources almost certainly applied principally to natural resources needed in ecological terms as populations grew, or climate undermined subsistence supplies, or drought affected access to water. Before fixed farming settlements, it is likely that raiding to capture grazing livestock was possible, but too little is known about early human communities as herders or hunters to be certain.

Fighting to take or to control material resources is more readily demonstrable only with the onset of farming, the shift to larger tribal communities, then the emergence of cities and the first proto-states or states. From that period on, looting materials or plundering enemy settlements was common and geographically widespread; the loot was one way to reward soldiers and motivate their participation. Tribute could also be exacted to fill the victor’s treasury even when peace had resumed. There were conflicts over control of trade routes, access to or control over valuable materials such as salt or mineral sources such as copper ore or jade, and finally the seizure of slaves or sacrificial victims, which seems to have been almost universal until only the past few hundred years.

By the time of the metal cultures in the last three millennia BCE, first copper, then bronze, and finally iron, fighting for control of valuable resources or their supply contributed more obviously to an endemic pattern of warfare, including the seizure of land where resources or rich pasture were available. The pattern of weaponry, armor, and horse equipment suggests that violent raiding became common. In Italy, trade and wealth became increasingly important by the Copper Age and early Bronze Age, and the major routes through Liguria or Veneto were protected by heavily fortified coastal towns. Sea raiding was also carried out along the Italian coastline to seize slaves, livestock, and valuables.18 A similar pattern emerged with the regular warfare evident in China and in the New World. In warfare among the early Chinese proto-states, control of key metals, particularly copper and tin, played a role.

The systematic spoliation of conquered peoples was brought to a new level through the emergence of the first major civilizations in the Near East and the Mediterranean basin. The best example is republican Rome in the first millennium BCE, where the seizure of treasure and resources and the exaction of annual tribute reached an exceptional level. Rome’s early expansion was based on raiding local towns and villages. Warfare provided not only the prospect of exacting tribute but also goods to distribute among the soldiers taking part, a key element not just in Roman warfare. Warfare was necessary to fuel the capacity to make war.

The defeat of Carthage in 202 BCE brought booty on a grand scale, to be divided between the Roman state, the military leaders, and the ordinary soldiery. In the Roman wars in Dalmatia and Greece, a primary motive was to ensure the security of the rich Adriatic trade, which Rome sought to dominate, against the pirates along the Illyrian coast. Expansion into Greece, though prompted by political ambitions, yielded further riches. It has been estimated that the wealth seized in the wars between 229 and 167 BCE amounted to 70 million denarii, in addition to the artwork and statuary looted back to Rome. In the conquest of Epirus, 150,000 captives were taken and sold as slaves to make money for the Roman treasury. The conquering Roman general Lucius Aemilius Paullus provided so much wealth to Rome that the Senate suspended direct taxation of Roman citizens indefinitely. When Corinth continued to resist, it was sacked in 146 BCE, its people killed or enslaved and its antiquities looted systematically.24 The predatory nature of Roman warfare was central to its imperial strategy. Warfare made Rome, the Roman elite, and Rome’s generals wealthy. The failure to bring resources back from campaigns was a sign of dishonor, aside from the challenge of buying off soldiers who had expected a share of the plunder. The Roman Republic and the Roman Empire set a pattern that survived across the historic period. Warfare for the next 2,000 years was not universally about material gain and predatory strategy, but there are endless examples of wars in which economic motives played some part whatever the political, ideological, or security interests involved. In much medieval warfare, the promise of booty in the absence of regular pay was the only way of keeping the army or militia focused on campaigning.

If kings or princes had their own motives, for many ordinary soldiers, material interests mattered most. Some of the Swiss mercenaries who joined foreign armies in the fourteenth century did so without pay but expected to take a share of the loot as recompense.25 The Ottoman sacking of Constantinople in May 1453, following a seven-week siege led by the sultan, Mehmet II, who wanted to eliminate the one remaining barrier to Muslim domination of the Near East, was a model of plunder warfare. Under Islamic law, three days of looting were permitted, but Mehmet, hoping to make the city his capital, permitted only one. His army, which had been close to mutiny as the promise of booty faded away during the prolonged siege, only needed a day. Anything portable was taken. Thousands of women and children were bound together in small groups to be dragged away by their captors to a life of slavery and concubinage. The rest of the population was slaughtered.26

How slaves were captured, however, has been much more difficult to reconstruct than the life of slaves once they had their place defined as commodities to be retained or traded. Slaves that were sold or exchanged—like the slaves taken across the Sahara for centuries to feed demand from the Islamic states of North Africa and the Middle East, or the estimated 9.5 million African slaves moved to the New World between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, or the estimated 1 million or more Europeans captured and sold by the Barbary corsairs between 1630 and 1780—were almost all in the first instance the victims of violent expropriation.

The capture of humans to use as slaves has no clear starting date. It probably happened among the early chiefdoms as they jostled for power and prestige, but there is no way of knowing with certainty except to look at more modern ethnographic examples.

In the Greek states, slavery was essential to the economy and the generation of wealth. Slaves were seen as a commodity, to be the subject of exchange and commerce. In the first century BCE, the Greek geographer Strabo described meetings between Greek merchants and nomads around the Sea of Azov in southern Russia, where hides and slaves were traded for wine and cloth.

The link between slavery and violence is less easy to demonstrate in other contexts, because most of the historical record deals with slaves when the initial violence was over and they were captive. This is true for slavery within Africa, which was widespread long before the start of the Atlantic slave trade.

In a few cases there is historic evidence of exactly how raiding for slaves was conducted. Seventeenth-century Portuguese and Dutch demand for slaves on the island of Timor and its surrounding islets relied on indigenous initiative in finding and trading slaves, usually from remote areas or mountain terrain where communities were peripheral or hostile to the local power holders. On Suva, local cavalry hunted in the hills for captives; on Solor, mountain people were captured and handed on. The Europeans also conducted their own raids, often with a punitive purpose. In 1665, Mateus da Costa attacked the kingdom of Wewiku-Wehali, seizing captives to send on to Portuguese enclaves at Goa and Macau;

Although recent interpretations have tried to show that the condition of being a slave in the Old World was often less coercive and penalizing than plantation work in the Americas, the fact remains that many, perhaps the majority of slaves over the past four millennia, began their condition as a victim of warlike violence.

THE PROBLEM IN EXPLAINING the economic, or materialist, source of warfare is to separate out other motives from the simple act of predation. There is no general rule. Wars in prehistory or the early civilizations are easier to see as predatory conflicts because of the evidence of what was seized. Some conflicts over mineral sources or trade routes could be regarded as resource wars if that was the chief object. Fighting to seize slaves or sacrificial victims could also be the main motive in raids from prehistory to the nineteenth century. But in many cases, the economic gain was a bonus or value added to a raid or a campaign, something hoped for but not the principal cause. Even in the case of Rome’s predation in Greece, there were political and security issues to explain the Senate’s decision, first to weaken a rival monarchy in Illyria, then to conquer Greece to prevent empires farther east from exploiting the peninsula as a jumping-off point for war against Rome, as Pyrrhus had done in support of a Carthaginian campaign in southern Italy and Sicily in the 270s BCE. In medieval and early modern warfare in Europe, plunder was certainly expected and needed to satisfy both commanders and men, but it was not usually the first reason the armies or navies were in the field.

Some sense of the ambiguities present in any economic theory of warfare can be found in two examples from the modern age that have been popularly regarded as war over resources: the South African War (or Second Boer War) from 1899 to 1902 and the “Chaco War” between Bolivia and Paraguay from 1932 to 1937, the former over gold and diamonds, the latter over oil. In both these cases, the alleged intervention of capitalists was taken as evidence that material ambition must explain the conflict. The conspiracy theory of capitalist complicity was first publicized for the South African War by the liberal journalist J. A. Hobson in a book published in 1900. He claimed that war was brought about by a “small confederacy of international financiers” who wanted to take power in the Afrikaner republic of Transvaal where they had interests in the rich gold-mining area of Witwatersrand.

the mining interests in Transvaal wanted to avoid war, though they did hope the British government would pressure the Afrikaner government of Paul Kruger to adopt policies that would benefit the continued modernization of the economy and pay more heed to the needs of the non-Dutch Uitlander (“outsider”) population. What was at stake were British imperial ambitions for the whole of southern Africa, represented by the High Commissioner at the Cape, Lord Milner. The priority for the government in London was political rather than economic, to assert British suzerainty across the region, including Transvaal, and to secure British strategic interests against the imperial competition of other powers, particularly Germany, in what was regarded as a key geopolitical area. The growing confrontation between the Kruger regime and the British in the years leading up to the outbreak of war derived from British demands for reform and recognition of British paramountcy, which undermined the desire of the Transvaal Dutch to remain as independent as possible from British intervention. Otherwise, wrote the Afrikaner politician Jan Smuts, “Africa will be dominated

By 1899, the Transvaal was fast becoming the major military and economic power in southern Africa. War came to be seen as the only way to rein in that power and reassert British ascendancy. The mine owners were a means for the British colonial establishment to insist on reform and political ascendancy, but protecting the interests of capital was not the end point of the conflict.41 Little of the gold ended up in the bullion supplies of the Bank of England, either before or after the conflict, because it was not central to British requirements. Resources were not the root of a conflict that stemmed instead from the imperial appetites of Britain’s governing classes.

In the Chaco War, economic motives were more evident, but the belief that the war was a product of capitalist manipulation was a fantasy, driven by the need to find someone to blame for a conflict that proved disastrous for the Bolivian regime of Daniel Salamanca, who had pressed for war in 1932 as a solution to social and political crisis at home. It was certainly the case that Standard Oil had negotiated a deal with the Bolivian government in 1924 for a fifty-five-year concession to exploit Bolivia’s small oil reserves and to explore for more in the eastern, lowland half of the country, but the company made only half-hearted efforts to do so, and when oil prices slumped later in the decade, it had little interest in adding to the global glut.42 Oil mattered to the Bolivian government because it promised to relieve heavy dependence on the trade in tin, especially when tin prices also slumped after the global economic crash in 1929. As Bolivia is landlocked, access to the Atlantic to export oil would be possible only by securing a port on the Paraguay River, which meant crossing the Chaco Boreal, a semitropical and arid region plagued by disease, its ownership contested for decades between Paraguay and Bolivia. At several flashpoints in the 1920s, the two countries almost came to blows in the Chaco, where they both had military outposts, but peace was kept through international arbitration. When Salamanca became president at the height of the economic slump, war was seen as a means to divert social crisis and possibly to open a route to the ocean if Paraguay could be pushed aside.43 In April 1932, the two armies clashed at a small lake in the Chaco Boreal, and when Paraguay retaliated two months later, a full-scale war developed, supported on both sides by a popular jingoism deriving from the ongoing confrontation over who owned the inhospitable area. In all of this, Standard Oil played no part, although in Paraguay and Argentina the press made great play with the idea of oil imperialism driving Bolivia’s decision. The company declared itself neutral in the conflict and moved equipment to Argentina for safety.

Bolivia did see the war as a means to rescue a failing economy by appealing to popular nationalism, but the decision was as much political as economic. It was an oil war only indirectly, as Bolivia already possessed the oil, and Paraguay had had no plans to take it. No oil has ever been found in the Chaco.

THE IDEA OF “RESOURCE WARS” has nevertheless become a central argument to explain warfare in recent decades, particularly violence between non-state actors in civil wars or insurgencies. It has also become, like “climate wars,” a way of predicting what may happen in the future as the potential tension between high population growth, global consumer demand, and the declining supply of nonrenewable resources—oil is the best known—prompts conflict between or within modern nations. The term “resource wars” was first used in the 1980s to describe possible struggle over resources as part of the Cold War, but it was used much more widely in the 1990s to explain persistent civil conflict in areas rich in nonrenewable resources, such as Nigeria or Sierra Leone. It has since been applied less discriminately to any conflict where control over the production, distribution, or international trade of both nonrenewable and renewable resources is contested violently. The World Bank in a 1999 report found that states dependent on what are called “lootable assets,” such as timber, diamonds, or scarce minerals, were four times more likely to experience conflict.

The modern resource war has something in common with conflicts from a much earlier age, where control of trade routes or mineral sites or the capture of humans to enslave or sacrifice might be the main cause of fighting. But in prehistory the resource range was limited and resources in practice abundant. The context for modern resource wars is the stark reality, predicted by the World Resources Institute in 2000, that by 2050 there will be 9 billion humans supplied by a fourfold increase in industrial production eating up not only nonrenewable mineral and energy resources but also those resources that are renewable, such as forests, which disappear more rapidly than they can be replenished. In this scenario, eventual conflict over resources might seem unavoidable.46 A 2009 report of the United Nations concluded that eighteen of thirty-five conflicts during the previous decade concerned exploitation or control over natural resources, and they did not include the 2003 Second Gulf War, in which regulation of oil supplies was indeed a major factor.

In any assessment of the modern conflict-resources argument, it is important to distinguish between different kinds of resource, different kinds of conflict, and different geopolitical conditions. Most resources are traded peacefully and legally, even where there is tension between supplier and consumer. Many resources are abundant enough not to merit conflict over their supply. The resources associated most closely with conflict are to be found in areas of the world where political or ethnic tensions or social grievances already exist. These include diamonds and other gemstones, old-growth hardwoods, rutile (or titanium ore), copper deposits, rare animals or animal parts, and, above all, oil.

association with conflict is found overwhelmingly in former colonial areas or areas where the imperial powers, most notably Britain and France, held a dominant political and commercial position: the Middle East, colonial Africa, southern Asia, the Pacific. These are not the only places—there is tension over oil supplies in the Caspian region and in the oil regions of Latin America—but they are sites of the civil wars, insurgencies, and outside military interventions usually regarded as part of the resource wars repertoire.

The one resource in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries to have produced interstate warfare, rather than conflict at substate level, is oil. Together with natural gas supplies, widely exploited only from the 1960s, oil plays a critical role in supporting the industries and lifestyle of the developed world and increasingly of the developing world as well. More discoveries have been made to compensate for rising consumption, but for every two barrels of oil consumed, only one new one is discovered. Global oil production reached the midpoint of known available reserves about 2010 and is widely predicted to run out at some time between 2040 and 2060.52 Natural gas can still be found in large quantities, but much of it is poorly accessible, and its extraction will depend on the evolution of technology capable of retrieving it. For the most oil-dependent states, in Europe, East Asia, and the United States, oil security has been a major strategic priority, not least because a high proportion of oil reserves is to be found in areas with a long history of conflict and potential instability, particularly the Middle East, or in areas where colonialism has left a legacy of ethnic or religious conflict and democratic failure, as in Libya, Sudan, Nigeria, or the Congo basin. Oil lay at the heart of the so-called Carter doctrine, announced by US president Jimmy Carter in 1980 after the Islamic revolution in Iran: that deliberate interruption of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf would be “repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” General Robert Kingston, the first commander of US Central Command, covering the Middle East, understood that his role was “to assure unimpeded flow of oil from the Arabian Gulf.”53 In the year 2000, Russian military doctrine, endorsed by the recently elected president, Vladimir Putin, specified maintaining the security of Russia’s territorial waters, continental shelf, and exclusive offshore economic zone with its potentially rich resources of oil and gas.54 In 2007, two Russian submarines planted the Russian flag 4,000 meters under the North Pole, where large deposits of natural gas and oil are known to lie, as a preliminary to laying claim to the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater mountain range linked, it is claimed, with Russian territory. The claim remains contested by Canada and remains a potential site of conflict.

The history of the interstate war for oil in the twentieth century is well known. In the Second World War, some 90 percent of natural oil output was controlled by the Allies; the Axis states, Germany, Italy, and Japan, controlled just 3 percent of output and 4 percent of refining capacity. Germany dominated the supply of its ally, Romania, but that provided too little to satisfy the military and economic demand of German consumers.

The invasion of the Soviet Union had a range of motives, ideological and material, but seizing and exploiting Soviet oil in the Caucasus region was a priority, even though German industry lacked the technology and expertise necessary to extract the oil rapidly, even if it had been captured. For Japan, where oil dependence was even more pronounced, the sanctions applied by the United States in the summer of 1941 tipped the balance in the strategic arguments of Japan’s armed forces in favor of confronting the United States and the colonial powers, Britain and the Netherlands, whose Southeast Asian colonies had large supplies of oil. Like the German case, the conflict with the West was a more complicated affair than simply the search for oil, but no other motive was more significant in the Japanese choice of strategy taken in the summer of 1941 and in the planned direction of advance. Alongside the oil, there was also the prospect of other resources that the Japanese war effort needed: iron ore, bauxite for aluminum production, and manganese ore. The result was not what had been intended. The oil was captured, but three-quarters of it was used to fuel the Japanese war effort in the Pacific theater rather than the Japanese home islands, while most of the large Japanese tanker fleet, including new tanker tonnage of 1 million metric tons, was on the ocean floor by 1945, destroyed by the US submarine fleet. For the Allies, heavily reliant on air power, ground mobility, and long oceanic sea-lanes, oil was almost never a problem.

’Tis not altogether improbable, that when the nation become heartily sick of their debts, and are cruelly oppressed by them, some daring projector may arise with visionary schemes for their discharge. And as public credit will begin, by that time, to be a little frail, the least touch will destroy it, as happened in France; and in this manner it will die of the doctor.

Law’s ambitious monetary experiment and, in particular, his policy of expanding France’s money supply and cutting interest rates. While Locke considered the inconveniences that might take the rate of interest below its natural level, Law conducted the world’s first experiment with easy money. His story of boom and bust is a cautionary tale for our times.

In his Essay on a Land Bank (c. 1703–4) and Money and Trade Considered (1705), the fugitive Scot displayed novel insights about the nature of money. Money, he said, did not derive its value from precious metals, as people like Locke believed. Rather, money was simply a yardstick of value; or, as he put it, ‘Money is not the Value for which Goods are exchanged, but the Value by which they are exchanged.’5 This clever switching of the prepositions – by in place of for – amounted to a monetary revolution.

A constant theme in Law’s writings is that trade depends on the circulation of credit, and that credit was ‘only lost by a scarcity of Money’.6 Here Law anticipates later monetarists. He argued that prosperity could be achieved by establishing a bank that issued paper money, collateralized with land rather than gold and silver. By severing the link between money and precious metals, Law opened the possibility of a managed currency.

Law’s ideas about money were the product of his age. As the son of a goldsmith-banker, the young Law would have observed how his father’s notes were accepted for the settlement of debt.7 By the late seventeenth century, inland bills of exchange financed much of England’s domestic trade. Defoe scorned any claim that Law might have to originality; the notion that paper credit could serve as money, lessening the need for hard currency, he wrote, ‘are common topics that every stock-jobber is master of’.8 Nor was Law the first to propose a land bank; that honour belongs to a certain William Potter who came up with the idea during Cromwell’s Protectorate. Law was one of several contemporary land bank advocates writing at the close of the seventeenth century. Another influence on Law’s thinking was the Bank of England, which opened its doors in the spring of 1694 at around the date of his murder conviction. The Bank’s first issue of paper notes was backed not by gold but by a claim on the public credit, which derived from a large loan made by shareholders to the government of William of Orange. Law was later to imitate this example. After leaving Britain, Law lived at times in Amsterdam, home to Europe’s first central bank, the Wisselbank (established in 1609), and in Genoa, whose leading bank, the Casa di San Giorgio, had been founded in the fifteenth century to consolidate the city’s debts.fn1

On several occasions Law attempted to interest governments in his land bank scheme, but he was turned down successively by the English, the Scots, the Duke of Savoy and by Louis XIV of France. As Keynes later lamented, the most problematic aspect of having new economic ideas is persuading others of their virtue.

Finally, Law’s luck changed. Louis XIV died in September 1715. As the heir to the throne, Louis XV, was a mere five-year-old, France came under the regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, a louche character more open to new ideas than his uncle, the late king. The Regent faced a dire situation. The royal finances had been ruined by Louis XIV’s endless wars. The king’s debts were roughly the size of France’s total annual output, and tax revenues were inadequate to cover interest payments. The debt traded at a large discount to its nominal value. France’s economic situation was parlous: ‘Bankruptcies were rife; thousands of workers were unemployed; manufactures were idle; commerce was stagnant; and agriculture in distress,’ writes the economic historian Earl J. Hamiltion.fn2 Money was scarce and prices were falling. At this opportune moment, Law, who had recently settled in Paris, made a proposal to the Regent.

The French state, he suggested, faced two pressing problems: it owed too much and paid too much on its debt. He proposed that France establish a national bank, modelled on the Bank of England: The bank is not the only nor the biggest of my ideas – I will produce a work which will surprise Europe by the changes that it will generate in France’s favour, changes which will … establish order in its financial situation, to restore, provide for, and increase agriculture, manufactures, and trade, to increase the size of the population and the general revenue of the kingdom, to repay the useless and onerous ‘charges’, to increase the King’s revenues while caring for the people, and to reduce the state’s indebtedness without hurting its creditors.9 France would become the arbiter of Europe, Law promised. All this would be achieved ‘not by laws, but by an abundance of money’.10 Within a few years, the ambitious projector would prove as good as his word.

In modern language, Law was suggesting that a central bank could reduce interest rates by printing money; that this would alleviate the position of heavily indebted borrowers (in this case, French nobles), create jobs and revive the economy. At the same time, the cost of servicing government debt would fall and deflation come to an end. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the world’s central bankers acted with similar intentions.

In his early pamphlets, Law argued that interest was determined by the supply of money and that a national bank could bring about a reduction in interest by increasing the money supply. He believed that the Dutch enjoyed lower borrowing costs because they had a greater quantity of money in circulation (not, as Locke and others supposed, because the Dutch were thrifty and possessed a greater stock of capital). The Scotsman ascribed the gradual decline in European interest rates over the previous couple of centuries to inflows of silver from South America. During his stay in Genoa, he observed how interest rates in the city dipped whenever Spanish bullion ships appeared on the horizon.

Law saw the bullion ships in the ports of Genoa and saw the traders lowering their interest as a consequence. This paradox is explained by the fact that relative abundance of silver money compared to paper money and bills of trade - had led to the destruction of value of silver. And as a result the bankers were giving less paper money in return for silver.
If an economy wants to lower interest rates and keep inflation in check, it must produce a lot more of everything which money can be exchanged for. This is where the idea of productivity comes in

The Regent’s Council initially rejected Law’s proposal of late 1715 to establish a national bank in France but granted him permission for a private bank. The General Bank, as it was called, opened its doors in May 1716. The bank received the patronage of the Regent, who took a large shareholding and issued an edict making its notes legal tender for the payment of taxes. These notes were redeemable in gold but, unlike gold and silver coin, they could not be debased by royal command. The General Bank’s main business lay in managing accounts, discounting bills of exchange and providing foreign exchange services. It sported a conservative balance sheet, earned decent profits and paid generous dividends. This was only the first step. A year later, Law took over a company that possessed monopoly trading rights and land claims to French Louisiana, an area covering roughly half the current landmass of the United States (excluding Alaska). The Company of the Indies is better known to posterity as the Mississippi Company. Law subsequently merged this business with France’s other trading monopolies (the Senegal, East India and China companies), along with the tobacco monopoly, the contract to farm the royal taxes and the mint. To cap it all, in the late summer of 1719 Law arranged for the Mississippi Company to take over France’s entire national debt, in exchange for an annual payment. Government creditors were given the opportunity to swap their bonds for shares in Law’s company. In the space of three years, the Scotsman had created ‘the most colossal financial power ever known’.13 His System, encompassing commercial, debt management and banking operations, was the most ambitious economic experiment prior to the Russian Revolution.

In December 1718, the General Bank was nationalized and renamed the Royal Bank. This was the type of institution that Law had envisioned in his earlier writings. Unlike the General Bank, the Royal Bank’s notes were denominated in the unit of account, the livre tournois, rather than gold. This removed any restriction on the amount of money that could be issued.

Over the course of 1719, their price climbed some twentyfold, peaking at close to 10,000 livres. Investors who had bought into the first subscription with depreciated government debt increased their money by more than forty times. The French coined a new word, millionaire, to describe these lucky fellows. A speculative fever enveloped the nation and soon the whole of Europe had caught the bug.

The prospects of the Mississippi Company were hyped by Law’s agents in the press. Louisiana was described as a new El Dorado, abundant with gold and other precious metals. Le Nouveau Mercure reported that its fertile land was populated with marsupial rats the size of cats that supposedly tasted like suckling pig.19 Settlers en route for the colony, many of German extraction, were equipped with shiny new tools and paraded through the streets of Paris. (What these colonists encountered on their arrival at the nascent settlement of New Orleans was rather different from what had been described by Law’s propagandists. An early visitor, the Jesuit priest Father Charlevoix, found that New Orleans consisted of ‘one hundred randomly situated huts, a large wooden store, and two or three houses unworthy of any French village’.20 The settlers faced a variety of illnesses, including ‘fevers, scurvy, dysentery, venereal diseases and leg ailments’.21 Around half of them perished or returned to Europe.22)

The main stimulus for the bubble came from the Royal Bank’s printing press. Over the course of 1719, the amount of paper money in circulation increased by an estimated billion livres.23 The bank employed eight printers around the clock to crank out notes in large denominations. The most commonly issued note was worth 10,000 livres.24 The money-printing became so furious that the handwritten signature of the bank’s cashier had to be replaced by a printed impression (as on modern banknotes). Saint-Simon claimed that ‘the printing of shares and banknotes was actually delayed because the manufacturers could not supply paper fast enough!’25 By May 1720, the total circulation of notes exceeded 2 billion – an increase of fifty times on the earlier issuance of the General Bank, and roughly twice the quantity of gold and silver coins in circulation.

As banknotes gushed forth, French interest rates collapsed. In August 1719, the Mississippi Company agreed to take over some 1.2 billion (later raised to 1.7 billion) livres of France’s national debt, for which it was to receive a payment of 3 per cent. Government creditors could exchange their bonds for shares, but those who refused this offer would find the interest payment reduced to 2 per cent (from 5 per cent).

In his earlier writings, Law had expressed the view that East India Company shares were like money since they could be used for the settlement of debt. Under his System, bank money and Mississippi stock became interchangeable. Loans to speculators, supplied against share collateral, were provided by the Royal Bank at 2 per cent. The Mississippi Company also acquired copious amounts of its own stock with loans from the bank. When the share price dipped in early October 1719, the Company offered to buy back shares at a 10 per cent premium to the market price.

Law opened a bureau d’achat et de vente (buying and selling office) so that the Company could intervene continuously in the market for its shares. Its massive share buybacks were financed with zero interest loans.

1720, the Royal Bank and the Mississippi Company were merged into a single corporate entity, and by mid-February some 800 million livres of banknotes had been created to purchase Company shares.29 The decline in interest rates, together with the increase in dividends, appeared to justify the rapid climb in the Mississippi share price. At the market peak in late 1719, the yield on government debt stood at 2 per cent and loans for share purchases (margin loans) cost the same amount, while Mississippi shares traded at close to fifty times earnings and paid a dividend equal to 2 per cent of the market price (admittedly, the dividend was not quite covered by earnings). Law himself was aware that the valuation of the Company’s shares depended on the rate of interest.

Nicholas Dutot, a treasurer to the Company, observed that falling interest rates had ‘carried the value of lands to 80 and 100 years purchase [i.e. a rental yield of around 1 per cent], raised up stately edifices both in town and country, [and] repaired the old houses which were falling to ruin’.32 A friend of the Regent’s mother acquired a large town house with her speculative gains, which she rented out for the ‘fiftieth penny’

The Mississippi Company dominated France’s economy and overwhelmed its nascent stock market. ‘No company before or since has had a greater share of the world’s investment capital than the Compagnie des Indes in the autumn of 1719 … In comparison, Apple Inc is a rag-and-bone shop,’ writes Law’s biographer James Buchan.36 Law’s personal stake in the Company made him, by his own calculation, the richest individual who had ever lived. He soon acquired a great property empire, comprising fifteen estates scattered around France and several properties in the capital. In Paris, he bought the vast Palais Mazarin, for which he paid a million livres, together with five houses in the Place Vendôme and ten houses in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.fn5 Law and his brother William borrowed nearly 20 million livres from the bank to purchase shares and property.

Yet no sooner had Law’s great edifice been put together than it started to collapse. The reasons for this failure are complex. The Scottish interloper had created powerful enemies, among them the financiers who previously farmed the royal taxes and were eager to make a comeback. Members of the Paris Parlement also loathed Law, whose reforms threatened to end their venal existence. Several contemporaries, including Saint-Simon, believed that Law’s efforts were doomed from the start because he was attempting to introduce modern institutions of finance – a national bank, paper credit, a funded national debt and joint-stock companies – that were vulnerable to the whims of the autocratic French monarch.fn6 To make matters worse, Law availed himself of the monarch’s absolute powers to impose his System upon the French nation. In order to make his banknotes appear more attractive, Law, on several occasions, altered by decree the monetary value of gold and silver. He forced the banknotes upon the people. When leading Mississippians, led by the Prince of Conti, started to realize – another neologism thrown up by bubble, meaning to convert ‘ideal property into something real’ – their profits, exchanging banknotes and shares for ‘other things more solid than paper’, Law responded by banning the possession of precious metals.fn7 His dictatorial bent is revealed in a pamphlet of March 1720 in which he railed against the hoarding of money. Government should not allow capital to ‘become a bolt-hole or port in a storm’.fn8 Law later added that since money was intended to circulate wealth ‘you are not allowed to use it for other purposes’. Law’s tyrannical and sometimes whimsical measures only served to undermine confidence in the new paper currency.42 In other ways, Law’s character vitiated the success of his project. Vanity and ambition appear to have turned his head.

Law was not interested in detailed business operations and the French Regent’s confidence was only ever provisional. After his departure he made the remarkable confession in a letter to the Regent that he had ‘always hated work’. But even had Law acted less impetuously, behaved less dictatorially and paid more attention to operations, his System would still have foundered because its monetary foundations were unstable. Towards the end of 1719, the massive issue of banknotes had produced a ‘wild inflation’, evidenced by the near doubling of an index of commodity prices since the start of the year.47 As confidence in the paper currency began to evaporate, money flowed out of the country. Law faced an intractable dilemma: he could either continue printing money to support the share price, at the risk of galloping inflation and further currency collapse, or he could remove the excess note issue at the risk of bursting the bubble.

Richard Cantillon. This Parisian banker of Irish descent had once collaborated with the Scottish projector, even sending his brother Bernard to develop a settlement in Louisiana. Having initially been bullish, Cantillon turned bear. His Essai Sur La Nature du Commerce, written in the 1730s, is considered to be one of the great early works on economics.

In the short-term, Cantillon averred, a national bank could drive down interest rates by purchasing government debt with newly printed money. Expectations of further declines in interest rates would induce the public to acquire bonds, further lowering market rates and raising the price of securities. Such banking operations were fraught with risk, however. The economy would prosper only as long as the extra money balances, created by the note issues, remained trapped within the financial system: ‘The excess banknotes, made and issued on these occasions, do not upset the circulation [i.e. produce inflation], because being used for the buying and selling of stock [i.e. financial assets] they do not serve for household expenses and are not changed into silver.’50 But once the money escaped into the wider economy, consumer prices were bound to rise. Besides, said Cantillon, it was all very well for the bank to buy stocks in a rising market. But to whom would it sell them in a falling one? ‘If the Bank alone raises the price of public stock by buying it, it will by so much depress it when it resells to cancel its excess issue of notes.’

If buying government bonds with printed money or quantitative easing (are they the same?), it must be ensured that this new money does not escape into the wider market. Central banks managed this tightrope perfectly until the pandemic hit. Then as soon as the governments started putting money directly into the hands of people and corporations by backstopping their bonds, the money managed to escape into the wider economy and led to dramatic inflation

After the bubble burst, Mississippi Company shares lost around 90 per cent of their value, falling back to the level they had traded at in 1718. François Velde, an economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve, estimates that a fair value for Mississippi stock during the bubble year was around 1,875 livres, roughly a fifth of the peak share price.54 This was not the first time, nor the last, that speculators would place too high a price on some exciting new development.

Two centuries later, Earl J. Hamilton advanced Cantillon’s monetary critique. It was clear that interest rates were too low during the bubble years, but the Scotsman was ‘irrevocably committed’ to easy money, said Hamilton.52 Only a couple of years earlier, French commercial loans had cost around 6 per cent. Yet in 1719, the Royal Bank lent at 2 per cent and private loans were available for even less.53 Hamilton identified a discrepancy between the ‘natural rate’ of interest and the Royal Bank’s artificially depressed interest rate.fn9 Had Law reversed course and hiked rates, the price of the Mississippi stock – which, as we have seen, was only justified by the 2 per cent discount rate – would have crashed.

James Buchan writes, their delusion lies in the conception of time. The great stock-market bull seeks to condense the future into a few days, to discount the long march of history, and capture the present value of all future riches. It is his strident demand for everything right now – to own the future in money right now – that cannot tolerate even the notion of futurity – that dissolves the speculator into the psychopath.55 It seems no coincidence that the speculator’s mistaken conception of time has often appeared at moments when the price of time was abnormally low, as it was in France in 1719. Law himself understood the time value of money and had earlier criticized competing land bank promoters for proposing excessively low interest rates.fn10 The ‘interest of money’, wrote the youthful Law, ‘is not to be lowered by setting up a species of money that is less valuable than silver money’.

Central bankers, who resort to printing money, manipulating interest rates and fuelling asset price bubbles, exude a similar air of infallibility. They fail to heed Cantillon’s warning that it’s all very well to embark on a grand monetary experiment, but there is no painless exit. ‘What central bankers are doing now is exactly what Law recommended,’ Law’s biographer Antoin Murphy wrote in the wake of the global financial crisis. ‘From this perspective, it may be argued that, notwithstanding the failure of the Mississippi System, Law’s banking successors have been Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi.’

T]hose who have so much to say about the sin of usury have not ordinarily been endowed by Providence with the means for committing it.’2 This was the scornful verdict of the Neapolitan abbé Ferdinando Galiani, one of the great wits of the eighteenth century and a favourite member of the Parisian salons. Nietzsche considered Galiani ‘the most profound, sharp-sighted and perhaps also the most salacious man of his century’. He was also a first-rate economist – ‘one of the ablest minds that ever became active in our field,’ according to Schumpeter – who explained why useful things like water have a lower market value than diamonds, more than a century before other economists developed the theory of marginal utility.3 In his book On Money (1751), Galiani turned his attention to the ancient problem of usury.

Galiani rejected the traditional view that charging for loans was inherently unjust. On the contrary, he correctly described interest as representing the difference ‘between present money and money that is distant in time’.

Galiani justified the existence of interest on the grounds that each loan carries some risk of loss, which induces anxiety in the lender. ‘Keeping someone in anxiety is pain, hence it must be paid for,’ Galiani concluded. ‘What is called the product of money, when it is legitimate, is simply the price of anxiety: and whoever thinks it is something different is mistaken’

Galiani saw that probability calculus, which in his day was already applied to commercial insurance, might also be used in the lending business. Interest, he wrote, ‘bears the same ratio to the capital as the probability of loss bears to the probability of repayment’. Since each loan carries a different risk, interest is as varied as are the almost infinite degrees of probability of loss, which is very great in some cases (as in maritime usury), sometimes falls to zero (as in the banks and companies of republics), and sometimes even below zero, becoming a negative quantity (as happened in France in the time of Law’s System).fn1 Viewed from this perspective, interest, said Galiani, can be seen as the ‘price of insurance’.

The idea that interest and risk are interconnected had ancient roots. As we have seen, the Babylonians, Greeks and Romans all charged higher premiums for loans on sea voyages. Yet Galiani’s description of interest as an insurance premium is also strikingly modern. Finance in the twenty-first century is underpinned by the role that interest plays in pricing risk. An enormous variety of risks are incorporated into the rate of interest: credit risk (which can be divided into default and recovery risk), legal risk, liquidity risk and inflation risk. Fixed-income bonds are exposed to future changes in interest rates (known as ‘duration risk’). A bank acts much like an insurance company. The spread between what the bank charges for its loans and pays on deposits is akin to an insurance premium.fn2 In fact, bonds can be replicated with insurance contracts, known as credit default swaps (CDS). The yields on CDS vary with the probability of default, as Galiani thought should be the case.

Galiani justified the existence of interest on the grounds that each loan carries some risk of loss, which induces anxiety in the lender. ‘Keeping someone in anxiety is pain, hence it must be paid for,’ Galiani concluded. ‘What is called the product of money, when it is legitimate, is simply the price of anxiety: and whoever thinks it is something different is mistaken’4. Galiani saw that probability calculus, which in his day was already applied to commercial insurance, might also be used in the lending business. Interest, he wrote, ‘bears the same ratio to the capital as the probability of loss bears to the probability of repayment’. Since each loan carries a different risk, interest is as varied as are the almost infinite degrees of probability of loss, which is very great in some cases (as in maritime usury), sometimes falls to zero (as in the banks and companies of republics), and sometimes even below zero, becoming a negative quantity (as happened in France in the time of Law’s System).fn1 Viewed from this perspective, interest, said Galiani, can be seen as the ‘price of insurance’.

Insurers employ actuaries to calculate loss probabilities. The types of risk they insure – homes, cars, business, lives, and so forth – are normally independent of each other. But badly underwritten insurance policies change people’s behaviour. For instance, if car insurance is priced too cheaply, more bad drivers take to the roads leading to a rise in the number of car accidents. Subsidized home insurance encourages people to build on flood plains or move into hurricane-prone areas. In extremis, moral hazard might induce a policyholder to burn down his house so he can claim on the insurance.

Moral hazard also occurs when the interest rate – Galiani’s price of insurance – is set too low. Credit booms occur at times of easy money, when financial risks are mispriced and market participants believe that the authorities will protect them from loss. On the eve of the financial crisis, insurance giant Marsh ran an advertising campaign with the slogan, ‘I risk therefore I am.’ The timing was poor but the sentiment correct. Capitalism is an economic system which both rewards and punishes people for taking risks. Homo capitalisticus is a risk-taker, and a stable economy requires that risks are correctly priced. When the price of risk is set too low, too much risk is assumed, new risks multiply and the financial system becomes unstable.

investors are prone to behave rashly when interest rates fall below a certain level. A desire to maintain the income of their investments induces them to speculate. A recent study finds that when government bond yields fall below average investors take on more risk. ‘Interest rates play an important role in affecting risk-taking behavior,’ conclude researchers Yueran Ma and Wilte Zijlstra. Modern finance theory states that this shouldn’t be the case. But investors ‘have a deeply ingrained notion that saving is the preservation of wealth and wealth should grow at a “decent” rate’. They won’t accept a loss of income. What’s more, their propensity to assume risk moves inversely with the interest

When short-term rates are low, investors have an incentive to take out loans to buy assets that yield more income. The difference between the cost of borrowing and the return on risky loans is known as the ‘carry’. There are numerous types of carry trades, from hedge funds using leverage to buy mortgage-backed securities to landlords taking out mortgages on their rental properties. The returns from carry trades are asymmetric: investors generally enjoy a steady stream of small gains but are exposed to sudden large losses. In market parlance, carry traders are said to pick up nickels in front of steamrollers. (More crudely, they are said to ‘eat like a bird, shit like an elephant’.)

Losses on carry trades can’t be accurately predicted since their returns are skewed or ‘fat-tailed’. But financial black swans don’t appear out of a clear blue sky. Carry trades tend to blow up after periods of easy money, when leverage and other risks have accumulated in the financial system. When liquidity dries up and credit spreads widen, leveraged players are forced to unwind their positions and contagion spreads throughout the system. That’s what happened in the United States in early 2007 when defaults on subprime mortgages started to occur. Over the next couple of years, countless carry trades unwound. Banks, hedge funds and investment banks that had acquired mortgage securities with short-term loans went to the wall. Specialist carry vehicles or ‘shadow banks’ – mortgage real estate investment trusts, structured investment vehicles, bank conduits, and the like – collapsed in droves. Sellers of subprime credit default swaps, including the insurance giant AIG, discovered they had sold insurance too cheaply. In the complex and interconnected modern financial system, calculating the probability of loss had turned out not to be as easy as Galiani believed.

In the second decade of the new millennium, the bond market showed several bubble characteristics: abnormal valuations; a ‘this-time-is-different’ mindset among investors; moral hazard induced by continuous central bank interventions; massive bond issuance; and a widespread myopia that blinded investors to the prospect of losses. The bond vigilante, ever alert to the risks of fixed-income investing and demanding protection in the form of adequate interest compensation, was laid to rest. No capitalist was ever more supine than the millennial fixed-income investor. How else could one explain thirty-year Swiss bonds paying less than zero, or Eurozone sovereign debt being styled a ‘negative haven’ just months after the region emerged from its debt crisis?29 ‘The notion that negative-yielding bonds, denominated in a fiat currency, are a “safe” asset is a misconception that belongs in the next edition of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,’ asserted James Grant, editor of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer in the summer of 2016.30 ‘The biggest bond bubble in world history,’ pronounced hedge fund manager

Keynes believed that interest existed because savers had to be bribed to surrender the safety of cash. ‘The rate of interest,’ Keynes wrote in his General Theory, ‘is the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period.’33 As we have seen, the notion that interest stopped people from hoarding money went back at least to the seventeenth century. Liquidity is still valued in modern bond markets where less liquid (‘off the run’) securities generally sport higher yields than benchmark bonds, such as ten-year Treasuries. When interest rates decline to very low levels, however, investors blithely surrender liquidity for a little extra income. During Greenspan’s ‘easy money’ regime, money poured into asset-backed securities and other illiquid ‘shadow banking’ products. The subprime crisis produced a ‘dash for cash’, as leveraged players rapidly unwound their positions, producing extraordinary losses for the owners of illiquid securities.

If liquidity represents the ability to trade securities without moving their prices, volatility measures the price movement between trades. Liquidity and volatility are inversely related: volatility declines when liquidity is abundant, but as liquidity dries up volatility takes off. Finance theory sees volatility as a measure of risk, while market practitioners describe it as the price of uncertainty. Volatility has also been called the price of market liquidity. The most frequently cited measure of volatility is provided by the VIX index, which calculates the implied volatility of the US stock market from the options prices on the individual companies which constitute the S&P 500 index.

The attitude of central bankers to yield-chasing and the bond market bubble, and to increasing credit, duration, liquidity and volatility risk, was one of plausible deniability. Their theoretical models stated that monetary policy shouldn’t change investors’ perceptions of risk. In practice, this was an untenable position since the Fed was doing everything in its power to get investors to assume more risk. Chairman Bernanke got around the quandary by joking that quantitative easing worked in practice but not in theory. Central bankers denied that they were responsible for the collapse in long-term interest rates. One secular stagnation narrative that found favour among monetary policymakers was the claim that long-term rates had fallen because the demand for ‘risk-free’ bonds was outstripping their supply. Apparently, the financial world after 2008 was suffering from an abundance of caution. Yet a cursory observation of Wall Street suggested that investors were only too tolerant of risk. As for the supposed shortage of investment-grade debt, the stock of Treasury debt doubled in the post-crisis decade. If Treasuries were in short supply, it was largely because the Federal Reserve (and other central banks) had snapped up so many of them. In 2014, Larry Summers suggested that in the post-crisis period interest rates that were consistent with full employment were not consistent with financial stability.fn7 Seasoned market observers had no doubt that ultra-low rates were behind the frantic search for yield and that financial risks were mispriced. ‘[N]ever … have investors reached so high in price for so low a return,’ wrote PIMCO’s Bill Gross.49 ‘The Federal Reserve policy of zero per cent interest rates and monetary expansion,’ commented James Grant, ‘has, by design, forced investors further out on the risk–return spectrum than they would otherwise have been had short-term real interest rates been positive.’

In a landmark speech delivered in February 2013, Jeremy Stein, a Harvard economist serving a single term on the Fed’s board of governors, suggested that changes in the monetary environment had altered risk-taking behaviour. Stein observed the proliferation of covenant-lite loans, payment-in-kind bonds and rising leverage in the buyout world. ‘[A] prolonged period of low interest rates, of the sort we are experiencing today,’ said Stein, ‘can create incentives for agents to take on greater duration or credit risks, or to employ additional financial leverage, in an effort to “reach for yield”.’ Low rates, he added, had spurred the development of new financial products to satisfy the demand for investment income.fn8 Regulation was all very well, said Stein, but only monetary policy ‘gets into all the cracks’. Stein later pointed out that the Fed’s policy of hiking interest rates by small increments, or ‘baby steps’, so as not to frighten the markets, backfired. The central bank’s predictability encouraged financial players to take on more leverage. The more the Fed fretted about Wall Street, the more cautious it became, and the lower interest rates fell.

regulatory arbitrage has been around since Babylonian times. No matter how extensive the regulations nor how many regulators are employed, the authorities can never gather enough information to foresee and control every evasive manoeuvre.fn11 This is the central problem with central planning. The regime of ultra-low interest rates made their task even more intractable. As Claudio Borio pointed out, monetary policy and what was now grandly termed ‘macroprudential’ regulation pulled in opposite directions. When the price of leverage declines, the amount of borrowing increases and Wall Street has a stronger incentive than normal to evade regulations in search of an extra buck.56

Andrew Haldane identified another problem. Perhaps financial regulation didn’t reduce systemic risk, he suggested, but merely influenced where risk appeared. Haldane pointed to the fact that savings had left an increasingly regulated banking system for credit markets. ‘Risk, like energy, tends to be conserved not dissipated, to change its composition but not its quantum,’ said Haldane. ‘So it is possible the financial system may exhibit a new strain of systemic risk … now originating on the balance sheets of mutual funds.’59 The Bank of England’s top economist was on the right track but understated the problem. The quantum of risk doesn’t remain the same under all conditions. Ultra-low interest rates, as Bagehot understood and modern research confirms, encourage investors to take more risk. Ultra-low rates and central banks’ money-printing may have dampened market volatility, but, as Hyman Minsky pointed out – and the recent experience of the subprime crisis confirmed – financial stability is destabilizing.

Quantitative easing boosted asset prices and shrank credit spreads, but most of this newly created money wasn’t lent to consumers or businesses but was deposited by the banks at the Federal Reserve. The fact that the Fed in 2008 started paying interest on excess reserves (i.e. bank deposits at the central bank) gave banks even less reason to lend. The circulation of money through the economy slowed.8 In short, the Fed’s policy of keeping rates close to zero didn’t create inflation, but rather produced a lingering deflation.

cheap trade credit encouraged firms to construct longer supply chains, which, in turn, reduced the prices of traded goods. The proliferation of corporate zombies further added to deflationary pressures.fn3 Many industries faced chronic excess capacity. Corporate debt soared in the United States after 2008, but much of this lending was directed for financial purposes – whether share buybacks or leveraged buyouts (see Chapter 11). Low interest rates fuelled a takeover boom, which reduced competitive pressures and fostered monopolies and oligopolies. Since zombies, monopolies and financialized firms tend to invest less, collectively they lower the economy’s innate capacity for growth.

the unintended consequence of unconventional monetary policies was to reduce the economy’s trend growth rate, thereby lowering the natural rate of interest. Although the Federal Reserve didn’t take responsibility for this outcome, central bankers slowly came to understand that the natural rate was on a downward trend. A few years after the crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee – the body which sets the Fed funds rate – started to publish charts of each member’s prediction for the future course of interest rates. These ‘dot plots’, as they were called, showed that America’s monetary policymakers consistently overestimated the future level of interest rates. The FOMC’s median forecast for the ‘long term’ rate (the expected normal level of interest rates) trended downwards over time.

One way to keep monetary accommodation perpetually in place was to move the goalposts. Quantitative easing was originally instituted to restore order to financial markets during a period of panic – a modern extension of Bagehot’s lender of last resort rule (although without the Victorian’s restrictive conditions). But when the Fed launched its third round of QE in September 2012, its aim was to help the jobs market.fn7 The level of unemployment itself proved another moving target. The Fed’s forward guidance originally set an unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent as the threshold for normalizing monetary policy. But when the jobless rate reached this level in 2015, the FOMC concluded that further delay was justified because the ‘natural rate’ of unemployment had fallen. Fed Chairman Janet Yellen, who replaced Bernanke in early 2014, mused that the risks associated with interest rates at the zero lower bound justified keeping the policy rate at zero for longer than otherwise.12 In effect, Yellen was saying that the existence of ultra-low rates was in itself sufficient grounds for maintaining them.

Monetary interventions became progressively bolder. The Fed had started out in 2008 by acquiring a few hundred billion dollars’ worth of short-dated Treasury Bills, but later turned to buying bonds with lengthier maturities in order to push down long-term rates. The US central bank also assumed credit risk by acquiring mortgage securities. Even as memories of the financial crisis faded, the pace of the Fed’s securities purchases picked up.13 Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker lamented that the Federal Reserve had ‘extended to the very edge of its lawful and implied power, transcending certain long embedded central banking principles and practices’.14 But Bernanke did not share Volcker’s qualms. The Fed had its inflation and unemployment mandates to consider. (The Fed’s third mandate, the maintenance of ‘moderate long-term interest rates’, was hardly ever mentioned.)

The Federal Reserve acted as the bellwether for other central banks. The timeline for the adoption of quantitative easing after Lehman’s demise runs from the Federal Reserve (November 2008) to the Bank of England (March 2009), coincident with the massive expansion of the Fed’s own securities purchases, onwards to the Bank of Japan (August 2011), the European Central Bank (January 2015) and the Swedish Riksbank (February 2015). The Bank of England, Bank of Canada and ECB also copied the Fed’s forward guidance. By April 2013, when the Bank of Japan adopted an inflation target, Bernanke’s 2 per cent target was considered the ‘global benchmark’.

Interest arises out of inequality, and also affects the distribution of income and wealth. Righteous denunciations of usury, however, conceal a more complicated picture. In ancient times usury served to worsen inequality, as Marx suggested. But the extent to which interest aggravates inequality depends on the nature of the economic system and on the identity of borrowers and lenders. In traditional societies, usury is often practised on those in desperate need, such as peasant farmers. But taking interest in a modern capitalist economy isn’t always unfair. The historian R. H. Tawney described the changing attitudes to usury in sixteenth-century England: The theory of usury had been designed for an age in which the lender was rich and the borrower poor. Now the borrower was often a merchant who raised a loan in order to speculate on the exchanges or to corner the wool crop, and the lender an economic innocent, who sought a secure investment for his savings.

Marx may have excoriated usury in the ancient world, but he also understood that interest in a capitalist world was different. Interest under capitalism, he said, should be viewed as a division of the economic surplus between lenders (whom he called ‘money capitalists’) and borrowers (‘industrial capitalists’). A decline in interest rates didn’t necessarily benefit workers, Marx wrote, since ‘interest is a relationship between two capitalists, not between capitalist and labourer.’6 Irving Fisher denied that there existed any clear division between capitalists, workers, landlords and entrepreneurs. As borrowers and lenders, these different classes overlapped and the incomes of each were affected by interest.7 Nor is it the case that lenders are invariably richer than borrowers. In the modern world, many less well-off families have bank deposits and insurance policies while the rich are often heavily in debt.8 As Locke pointed out in the seventeenth century, ‘widows and orphans’ suffer when interest rates decline. Since the less well-off are forced to keep a greater share of their wealth in cash to meet emergencies, they suffer a disproportionate loss of deposit income when interest rates decline.

Since Josiah Child’s day, the business world has always advocated for easy money – as Child’s contemporary Daniel Defoe wrote, the ‘interest of money is a canker-worm upon the tradesman’s profit.’ There is another class involved in the fight over interest. Investment bankers and other financiers are often large borrowers. The financial world is divided between mighty borrowers and powerless lenders, great whales feed off the savings plankton. As Justice Brandeis observed, Wall Street uses other people’s money, and the less it pays for this use the greater its profits.

The question of interest has always been about justice, defined by St Augustine as a ‘virtue which renders to everyone his due’.10 Distributive justice requires that borrowers and lenders receive an equivalence of value. Usury is defined as the charging of excessive interest. But no word exists to describe too little interest. Nevertheless, justice is violated when lenders receive little or nothing while borrowers make fat profits from their loans. An equitable rate of interest is one that is neither too high nor too low.

It is no coincidence that the greatest fortunes have been gained during periods of abnormally low interest rates. In late sixteenth-century Europe, the entire wealth of Augsburg, a free city of the Holy Roman Empire, was concentrated in a few hands, mainly in those of the banker Jakob Fugger. The ‘astonishing feature’ of this era was ‘the lowness of the discount rates’.11 Fugger, described in a recent biography as ‘the richest man who ever lived’, earned his fortune by borrowing at rates of interest as low as 2 per cent, and lending the money onwards, mostly to Habsburg emperors, at 10 per cent or more.12 The magic of compound interest over more than three decades made Fugger, in the words of his epitaph, ‘second to none in the acquisition of extraordinary wealth’. At the height of his fortune in 1720, John Law considered himself to be the richest person in history. As we have seen, the Scotsman’s wealth peaked at a time when interest rates in France had fallen to 2 per cent while shares in his Mississippi Company traded at fifty times earnings (a 2 per cent earnings yield). John D. Rockefeller has an even better claim than Law to be considered the wealthiest man in history. The fortunes of the robber barons, such as Rockefeller, were amassed in the late nineteenth century when falling interest rates boosted the ratio of American wealth to incomes.13 Prior to the Great War, the Standard Oil boss was worth 2.6 million times the average annual working American’s wage.14 When the banker Pierpont Morgan died in 1913, leaving an estate valued at $80 million, Rockefeller commented: ‘and to think he wasn’t even a rich man.’15 A little more than a century later, Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos outdid the mighty Rockefeller with a fortune estimated at more than $200 billion – some 3.5 million times the average American’s income at the time.16 On the day the internet tycoon achieved this milestone, the Fed funds rate was firmly stuck at zero. Boosted by the low prevailing discount rate, Amazon shares traded on a price-earnings ratio above 100 times, more than twice the peak valuation of Law’s Mississippi Company.

In their history of inequality in the United States, Unequal Gains, Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson suggest that inequality picks up when financial development outpaces economic growth.17 As we have seen, the continuous decline in interest rates towards the end of the nineteenth century drove the ‘Morganization’ of American industry, earning vast fortunes for Wall Street bankers.

The Great Depression kicked off a multi-decade decline in inequality, what economists refer to as the Great Compression. The turning point came in the early 1980s, as falling interest rates inaugurated a decades-long bull market in stocks and bonds. Wall Street’s fortunes recovered. The leverage buyout industry emerged, minting fortunes for the founders of private equity firms and junk bond issuers, such as Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Interest rates continued declining in the 1990s. Over the course of that decade, ‘inequality went up mainly because of rising stock prices, asset valuations and the incomes drawn from stock option realizations and capital gains, as well as wages and salaries paid in sectors that were financed by new equity.’21

The policymakers’ attitude to blue-collar and non-finance workers’ stagnant incomes at the turn of the century, said Raghuram Rajan, was ‘let them eat credit’.30 Consumption growth was maintained by lowering interest rates and boosting the supply of credit to low-income households. Credit expansion fuelled a housing bubble, enabling Americans to extract equity from their homes to cover living expenses. ‘There is absolutely no doubt that the increase of inequality in the United States contributed to the nation’s financial instability,’

the relationship between inequality and interest rates runs in both directions. As we have seen, inequality in the United States only took off after interest rates started to fall in the 1980s. In the wake of the Dotcom bust, easy money inflated a wealth bubble, and the wealth bubble exacerbated inequality. The rise in inequality, in turn, lowered the economy’s growth prospects, and as the economy stagnated, so did workers’ incomes. In other words, low rates begot inequality and inequality begot lower rates.

The policymakers’ response to the crisis, said New York University economist Nouriel Roubini, amounted to ‘socialism for the rich, the well-connected and Wall Street’.46 If the central bankers didn’t see things this way, it was because their models contained a blind spot. The models assumed that every ‘representative agent’ earns the same income and holds the same amount of wealth.47 These absurd, simplifying assumptions meant ‘distributional issues are suppressed [in the policymakers’ model], leaving no space to consider the justice of the resulting outcome.’48 What this meant, in effect, is that central bankers paid little attention to the regressive impact of zero interest rates and other monetary novelties on the distribution of income and wealth.

The Fed had hoped that by boosting asset prices with easy money, consumers would go out and spend more. But within a few years of the crisis, the ‘wealth effect’ – people’s propensity to spend their capital gains – had fallen to half its historic average.51 Having borrowed too much during the credit boom, most Americans were forced to curb their spending. The demand for luxury goods remained robust, however.

Between 1987 and 2013 the number of dollar billionaires around the world increased tenfold and their share of global wealth nearly quadrupled. By 2015, it was estimated that 62 people laid claim to half the world’s total wealth (down from 388 in 2010).64 Since a large chunk of private wealth was stashed in offshore tax havens, reported figures understated the true extent of wealth inequality.65 Wealth wasn’t so much trickling down, said the aid charity Oxfam, as being ‘sucked upwards’.

Britain’s housing affordability crisis had damaging economic consequences. A dynamic economy requires that workers move freely between jobs. But as house prices climbed, there was a steep drop in the number of Britons moving home to start a new job.103 Young homeowners who took out large mortgages to buy a house had less money to spend on other things. Resources were diverted into building luxury apartments, which did nothing to improve housing affordability. As the cost of doing business climbed and inward migration declined, metropolitan areas were turning into ‘closed-access’ cities.

Many were assisted by a new financial institution, known as the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’. Homeownership was fast becoming a preserve of the professional classes.100 The British government offered a subsidy to first-time buyers in 2013, but this subsidy pushed up house prices even further.101 Politicians promised to build more homes, but the number of new houses needed to make housing affordable again was inconceivably large. Economists at the University of Reading came up with an alternative, summarized in a Bloomberg headline: ‘The Only Solution to Britain’s Housing Crisis May be a Crash’.

While the rich got richer, the poor stopped having children. High levels of student debt, weak income growth and elevated house prices discouraged young couples from starting a family. In the United Kingdom, the birth rate and housing market were inversely related: as house prices went up, the number of births fell.105 In parts of Europe worst affected by the sovereign debt crisis, a similar demographic dampening was observed.

In a letter to the Financial Times in early 2018, Yves-André Istel pointed out that since the early 1980s interest rates had declined from 15 per cent to less than 2 per cent: By itself, the mechanical effect of reducing accordingly the discount rate applied to estimated future cash flows explains largely the rise in value of equities (thus stock options and chief executive compensation), and real estate values. Bond prices rose equally, yields declined. Search for returns became desperate, and massive liquidity encouraged easy low-cost borrowing and leverage. All this benefited, obviously, those holding these assets, with a corresponding effect on inequality in the west.112 It is clear that unconventional monetary policies unleashed by the financial crisis had a profound impact on inequality. A Bank of England study (from 2012) estimated that quantitative easing boosted UK household wealth by more than £600 billion. As the top decile of households owned more than two-thirds of private assets, they benefited disproportionately.113 Another

It is not hard to discern a double standard in the policymakers’ approach. Banks with busted credit got bailed out, while homeowners with busted credit got foreclosed. Wall Street received zero-cost loans from the Fed, while millions of households paid triple-digit annual percentage rates (APRs) on loans from payday lenders, pawnbrokers and title-lenders. A decade after the financial crisis, credit-card charges remained at roughly the same level as at the turn of the century.117 As analyst Jamie Lee writes: Need determines yields. Less creditworthy means more needy. The wealthiest homeowners pay the lowest mortgage rates … There are two ways to interpret this relationship. The first is to consider that the neediest borrowers are also the riskiest … The second is to consider that the neediest borrowers can be squeezed the hardest.

Just as Bastiat predicted, the poor didn’t benefit from easy money. In the age of zero interest, old-fashioned usury was alive and well.fn9 Ben Bernanke claimed it was for the ‘greater good’ of the American economy that savers should suffer a loss of deposit income.119 But, as we have seen, low interest rates didn’t help the economy in the long run. Besides, the greatest beneficiaries from the Fed’s policies were the financial elite, who got to enhance their fortunes with cheap leverage at a time when asset values were driven higher by easy money.

Piketty rejected conventional explanations for inequality based on education and technology.126 Instead, he proposed a fundamental law: inequality rises whenever the return on capital (comprising profits, interest, dividends and rents) exceeds the growth rate of an economy. Piketty expressed this insight with the notation r > g, with r representing the return on capital and g the rate of economic growth.

The IMF tested his fundamental law in nineteen advanced economies and found that, for most countries, inequality declined when the gap between returns on capital and growth expanded.127 Nor do the historical data from the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century support Piketty’s hypothesis. During this period the rate of return on capital and interest rates declined and asset valuations rose.

Piketty assumed that wealth compounds with time, whereas in reality the rich divide their fortunes and most savings are spent in retirement.129 Rags to riches and back to rags in three generations remains the rule (what economists call the ‘Buddenbrooks effect’). Besides, if the rich accumulated capital without end, as Piketty envisaged, returns on capital must inevitably decline.* Piketty made a more fundamental error. He employed the terms ‘capital’ and ‘wealth’ interchangeably, making no distinction between capital, as represented by productive assets, such as plant and machinery, and wealth in the form of financial claims that have no link to production, such as government bonds or precious metals. Most of the ‘comeback of private wealth’, to which Piketty alluded, was in the form of financial claims, or virtual wealth, at a time when capital investment in the US economy was weakening.130

from the mid-1990s onwards the Fed’s monetary policies inflated a succession of wealth bubbles. Since wealth is unevenly distributed and top incomes are correlated with stock prices, these wealth bubbles were responsible for much of the increase in inequality. A central argument of this book is that wealth bubbles occur when the interest rate is held below its natural level. The natural or equilibrium level of interest can’t be directly observed, but it is indicated by the growth rate of the economy and the growth of its capital stock. Thus, inequality is liable to increase when the rate of interest is held below the economy’s growth

Our alternative ‘iron law of inequality’ can be annotated as r < g, with r signifying the rate of interest and g the economy’s trend growth. This formula, which is the inverse of Piketty’s, can explain both changes in the distribution of income and wealth during the 1920s and the rise in inequality since the 1980s and, in particular, the Great Immoderation of the post-Lehman decade.

interest affects both the valuation and allocation of capital. Interest also influences how much saving takes place. When people save for a rainy day or for retirement, they must consume less today. The exercise of thrift is not an easy task. Immediate pleasures generally rank higher than deferred gratification. As Oxford’s first Professor of Political Economy, Nassau Senior, put it in 1836: ‘To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power, or to seek distant rather than immediate results, are among the most painful exertions of the human will.’1 Interest is the wage of abstinence, said Senior.

Perhaps abstinence is the wrong word. Saving takes place over time. ‘To save,’ wrote Frédéric Bastiat, ‘is deliberately to put an interval between the moment when the services are made for the society, and that when the equivalent is received from it.’3 The reward for this ajournement is interest.

Imagine that the present and future are two countries, separated by a river. Finance is the intertemporal bridge that joins them together, connecting the present with the future. By acts of borrowing and lending, and saving and investing, we shift expenditures across time. Interest is the toll levied on borrowers for bringing forward consumption and the fee paid to savers for moving consumption into the future.fn1 The level of interest regulates the traffic on the bridge and its general direction. When the interest toll is raised spending is pushed into the future, and consumption is brought forward when the toll is lowered. In an ideal world, people should save enough to meet their future needs, but not so much that current spending is depressed. Under such circumstances, the traffic across the bridge is orderly in both directions. This delicate balance is upset when the market rate of interest falls below society’s ‘crystallized impatience’. When the interest rate is higher than an individual’s time preference, he or she will save more for the future. Conversely, when the market rate is below the public’s time preference people borrow to consume. An abnormally low rate of interest boosts current spending, but the benefits don’t last. You cannot have your cake and eat it,

Here’s how development economist William Easterly puts it: Becoming rich is a choice between today’s consumption and tomorrow’s. If I cut my consumption sharply and save a large proportion of my wage income, then in a few years I will be richer because I will have both wage income and the interest earnings on my savings. If I consume all of my wage earnings, then I will have just my wage earnings forever onward.

As Americans saved less, they borrowed more from the future. Household debt soared as homeowners extracted trillions of dollars through home equity loans. Personal consumption hit a record high.8 The United States sported the largest current account deficit in its history – a signal that the country was spending far more than it earned.9 While Ben Bernanke at the Fed warned of a global ‘savings glut’, the United States was suffering a dearth of domestic savings. After the housing bubble burst, consumers found themselves saddled with too much debt. The United States appeared to be on the brink of a ‘balance sheet recession’, the name given to economic contractions that occur when overstretched borrowers cut spending to pay off their debts. Whereas Japan’s balance sheet recession of the 1990s saw companies reduce their leverage, now it was the turn of US households to tighten their belts.

an ECB board member, Yves Mersch, warned that persistently low interest rates were forcing savers in some European countries to save more to accumulate the same amount of wealth as they would have done at a time of higher rates. Mersch pointed to a rise in the gross savings rate in Germany.24 There’s no question that the loss of savings income was deeply unpopular in that country, where nearly half of household financial assets were held on deposit.25 Negative interest rates were seen as a tax on savings. Germans referred to them as Strafzinsen – punishment rates.

European life insurers found themselves contracted to pay out more on their policies than their investments in the era of negative rates could safely yield. Just as Japan’s life industry was destroyed by falling interest rates in the 1990s, so Europe’s life companies were faced with insolvency.27

Americans complained less than Germans about the loss of interest income, it was because they were more likely to own their own home and to have direct exposure to the stock market. Germany, on the other hand, was a nation of renters and its citizens kept more of their savings on deposit. Thanks to the Federal Reserve, the S&P 500 soared, the US housing market recovered, and household wealth climbed to an all-time peak. This great inflation of paper wealth inured most Americans to the loss of deposit income.

The trouble is that soaring asset prices don’t make a nation any richer. They only produce the illusion of wealth. Investors enjoy capital gains when asset prices rise, but any immediate gains are offset by lower investment returns going forward.

When long-term interest rates decline, investors experience a windfall gain as bond prices increase. But since the bond’s coupon is fixed, investors who hold the security until it matures are no better off. In fact, bondholders as a class suffer when long-term rates decline since they must reinvest their coupons at lower yields.

Stock market investors are in a similar position. Over the long run, equity returns are inversely correlated with the market’s valuation. As with bonds, elevated stock prices imply lower future returns. In the United States, a balanced portfolio comprising of stocks and bonds has historically returned around 5 per cent after inflation.30 Ten years after the financial crisis, with the valuation of the US stock market at close to a record high and the yield on Treasuries near an all-time low, the expected return on a balanced investment portfolio was around half its historic average.

Commitments to pay cash to retirees are a liability to an institution that so promises. When interest rates decline, the current value of retirement liabilities increases – just as the market price of a bond increases when interest rates turn down. The steep decline in interest rates after 2008 produced what James Grant called a ‘bull market in liabilities’. Most people ignored this dismal state of affairs. Peter Fisher, a former Federal Reserve and Treasury official, explained how the wealth illusion took hold in the wake of the financial crisis: Because our financial assets are traded in markets and because we receive mutual fund and retirement account statements, we promptly saw the change [i.e. increase] in the value of our assets. We are much slower to appreciate the change in the present value of our liabilities, particularly the value of our future consumption expenditures.32

Record levels of paper wealth encouraged households to carry on spending. But the illusion of wealth was inherently fragile. Monetary policymakers could only conjure up further capital gains by pushing interest rates ever lower. Any attempt to normalize rates would threaten the wealth bubble, bringing about a massive loss of household wealth. In the short run, ultra-low interest rates boosted consumption by substituting bubble wealth for savings, but in the long run it was a disaster. Savings are needed for the accumulation of capital. Societies that don’t invest enough are doomed to stagnate.

On retirement, many people use their nest eggs to purchase an annuity that pays them a guaranteed income for life. The annuity itself is invested in government securities and other high-quality bonds. As bond yields fell after the financial crisis, the income provided by annuities declined in tandem. For instance, an annuity purchased in 2016 by a sixty-five-year-old American man paid a quarter less income than a decade earlier.37

The pension industry is less prone to the wealth illusion than ordinary folk. That’s because actuaries must consider the present value of a pension fund’s liabilities when assessing whether it has sufficient assets to meet its obligations. To value those pension liabilities, the actuary applies a discount rate to the plan’s expected future cash outlays. The discount rate is taken from the yield on government bonds.

Pensioners faced the prospect of their nest eggs running out. The World Economic Forum in 2019 observed that retirees on several continents were in danger of outliving their savings. The average American male retiree had enough savings for not quite ten years, leaving him eight years short. The ‘retirement gap’ for American women was close to eleven years. At least, Americans could be thankful not to be retiring in Japan, where the retirement gap was fifteen years for men and twenty years for women.59 Alongside longevity risk, pension providers faced the prospect that further declines in interest rates would swell their deficits. In fact, their actions exacerbated this risk. Egged on by regulators, pension managers hedged interest-rate exposure by purchasing long-dated bonds. Given that the top three hundred pension funds held some $15 trillion-worth of assets, their massive bond purchases contributed to the decline in long-term interest rates.60 In the United Kingdom, liability hedging by corporate pension funds drove the yield on fifty-year inflation-linked gilts into negative territory.61 Thus, low rates begot a pensions crisis and the pensions crisis begot lower rates.

In theory, higher interest rates would reduce pension liabilities. In practice, they would also hit the value of pension assets, making a bad problem even worse.62 Relief came from an unexpected quarter. A few years after the financial crisis, life expectancy in the United States and the United Kingdom ceased improving and briefly went into decline. If only this trend continued, a consultant gleefully pointed out, half of British corporate pension deficits would disappear.63

ever-escalating life insurance contributions. In August 2016, the New York Times reported that life companies were hiking premiums for elderly American savers. Policyholders who couldn’t afford the increased payments faced the loss of all their previous contributions. The daughter of an elderly couple from Georgia, who had taken out a universal life policy and couldn’t afford the increased premiums, was told in all earnestness by the family’s financial adviser: ‘Please don’t take this the wrong way and, not to be morbid, but your mother needs to die.’ The couple eventually decided to walk away from their policy, waving goodbye to their life savings.fn3

large amounts of fudge obscured the full extent of the mounting crisis. In the United States, pension providers assumed unrealistically high returns on their plan investments.51 At the same time, the discount rate used to calculate their liabilities was held above the market rate of interest.52 To cap it all, the Internal Revenue Service permitted private pension plan providers to use outdated mortality assumptions, further understating liabilities.53 The widespread use of dubious pensions assumptions produced, in the words of one commentator, an ‘intertemporal accounting error’.54 Had more realistic assumptions been employed, many pension providers would have been found insolvent. In the short run, however, the fudge stuck. Yet there was no hiding the fact that Americans were saving too

the Swiss National Bank. Like the Bank of England, from the time of its establishment through to nationalization in 1946 the Swiss National Bank had public investors and its shares were traded on the local stock exchange. The SNB’s monetary policies were the cause of its immense profits. Interest rates in Switzerland had been negative since early 2015, which meant the SNB levied a small charge on the hundreds of billions of francs deposited by its banking customers. To prevent its currency appreciating against the euro, the SNB had acquired lots of foreign assets, including bonds and shares. As the Wall Street Journal noted, printing money to buy securities was a ‘recipe for success’.1 Three centuries earlier, John Law, by merging France’s national bank with his Mississippi Company, had discovered the same recipe. At the peak of the Mississippi bubble, the Scottish projector claimed that his company’s share price was justified by the low prevailing rate of interest. The same might be said of the Swiss central bank’s shares. On the date when the SNB stock hit its peak in the spring of 2018, the yield on ten-year Swiss government bonds was close to zero. Apply a discount rate of zero to a stream of future dividends fixed in perpetuity – even a dividend so small that it was scarcely enough to buy a cup of coffee in a Zurich café – and you arrive at an infinite valuation. On this basis, SNB shares trading on a six-hundred-year payback were a bargain.

his Theory of Interest (1930), Irving Fisher deliberated on the relationship between house prices and interest rates: ‘the price of a house is the discounted value of its future income. In the process of discounting there lurks a rate of interest. The value of houses will rise or fall as the rate of interest falls or rises.’ Not long after Fisher, another American economist, John Burr Williams, described how the act of discounting was key to valuation. ‘Investment Value,’ Williams wrote in The Theory of Investment Value (1938), is ‘defined as the present worth of future dividends, or of future coupons and principal’.

real estate markets around the world reacted positively to the stimulus of ultra-low interest rates. From London to Sydney, residential property prices in the leading cities danced to the same monetary jig.3 As an executive at Savills, a property consultant, commented: ‘What happened was that, for the first time, the cost of money in most of the cities was similar – you might say quantitative easing [has] levelled the global playing field.’4 Real estate brokers referred to the favoured destinations of the world’s super-rich as ‘golden concrete’.5 In the United Kingdom, the country’s ‘housing crisis’ was generally ascribed to a lack of housebuilding. But the Bank of England’s decision to maintain interest rates at their lowest level in its three-hundred-year history had a more significant impact on affordability. While UK house prices were extremely expensive relative to household incomes, relative to mortgage costs they had never been cheaper. The Office for National Statistics found that most of the increase in housing wealth after 2008 came from the rising value of land rather than what it called the ‘assets overlaying the land’.6 Negative interest rates provided an even greater fillip to Europe’s housing markets. In Zurich, the ratio of house prices to rent reached a record level of 37 in 2016. By this date, Swedish real estate was experiencing double-digit inflation. Despite record levels of household debt, mortgage payments in Sweden had fallen to an all-time low.fn1 In neighbouring Denmark homebuyers were actually paid to take out mortgages. Danske Bank, the country’s largest mortgage provider, fretted that negative rates were propelling home prices into orbit. Norway’s Financial Supervisory Authority likewise ascribed runaway house-price inflation to the collapse in interest rates.7

During the financial crisis, the New York Fed stumped up tens of billions of dollars to bail out the investment bank Bear Stearns and insurance giant AIG. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms were encouraged to convert into bank holding companies so they could borrow directly from the Fed. On its own account, the US central bank acquired vast amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. By the end of 2008, the Fed’s balance-sheet footings exceeded $2 trillion, more than double the level a few months earlier. Fed staffers referred to ‘large-scale asset purchases’, but the rest of the world knew it as quantitative easing (QE).

Stock market bubbles often favour technology companies. This has been the case from the 1690s’ mania in London’s Exchange Alley for diving-bell stocks through to the internet bubble three centuries later. Exciting new innovations attract speculators because their profitability can only be imagined. But there’s another reason: since most of their profits lie in the distant future, the valuation of technology companies (also known as ‘growth companies’) is inflated when the discount rate falls. During manias, speculators are said to engage in ‘hyperbolic discounting’.

This mania was born of monetary conditions as much as technological developments. Without computers there could have been no blockchain or digital encryption. Without the internet, the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies could not have spread like wildfire. Yet as fans of this ‘digital gold’ argued, the debasement of currencies by central banks meant a new type of money was needed. Cryptocurrencies were popular with millennials, not just because they were tech savvy but because low prospective returns on conventional investments forced them to go for broke.

In the years between the stock market trough in early 2009 and the tenth anniversary of Lehman’s bankruptcy, US household wealth nearly doubled. By late 2018, American households were worth more than $100 trillion, a sum equivalent to five times US GDP. By comparison, household wealth in the post-war decades averaged just over three and a half times GDP. Total household wealth was higher than at its twin peaks in recent real estate and internet bubbles.28 Never before had Americans been so rich. Never before had they done so little to amass so much wealth.

The Victorian philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill argued that wealth consists of anything, ‘though useless in itself’, which enables a person ‘to claim from others a part of their stock of things useful or pleasant’. By Mill’s definition, a high-flying but otherwise useless cryptocurrency was wealth, as were other evanescent assets: the portfolio of a ‘high net worth individual’ invested in equity and bond derivatives; a private collection of contemporary art, featuring works by Jeff Koons, Lucien Freud and Francis Bacon, whose value could be monetized and used as collateral for further investments; loss-making or semi-fraudulent unicorns in Silicon Valley; unfunded pension promises; trillions of dollars’ worth of ‘good will’ on corporate balance sheets; and further trillions of bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve, an artefact of the central bank’s money-printing. As long as something had an exchange value it constituted wealth.

Yet Mill’s contemporary John Ruskin took issue. The Victorian art critic pointed out that wealth was derived from the Latin, valor, valere, meaning to be well or strong. Real wealth, in his view, came from ‘the possession of useful articles which we can use’. It did not exist in exchange but must have some inner quality: ‘where there is either no intrinsic value, or no acceptant capacity, there is no effectual value; that is to say, no wealth. A horse is no wealth to us if we cannot ride.’

another self-taught economist, Frederick Soddy. A chemist by training who had received a Nobel prize for work on radioactive isotopes, Soddy held that life is a struggle for energy and that capital was really a form of stored energy: ‘All wealth is the product of work, in the physical sense of the expenditure of available energy,’ he wrote. Soddy thought it absurd to measure wealth by exchange value since speculators could push up the price of commodities ‘without any addition to the national wealth’. Soddy concluded that ‘the “wealth” of millionaires turns out on examination to be virtual … and to consist mostly of claims to wealth.’31 Adam Smith would have agreed. ‘Real wealth,’ wrote Smith, derives from ‘the annual produce of the land and labour of the society’.32 By this light, much millennial wealth wasn’t real at all, but mere claims to wealth whose market value multiplied as the discount rate declined.

Professor John C. Edmunds of Babson College, Boston, in an article for Foreign Policy in the summer of 1996. Edmunds extolled the potential of what he called a ‘New World Wealth Machine’: Many societies, and indeed the entire world, have learned how to create wealth directly. The new approach requires that a state find ways to increase the market value of its stock of productive assets … An economic policy that aims to achieve growth by wealth creation therefore does not attempt to increase the production of goods and services, except as a secondary objective.

The simplest and most effective way to inflate the value of productive (and not so productive) assets was by lowering the rate of interest. This was the path chosen by the Federal Reserve after 2008. The rationale for ultra-low rates was expressed by Chairman Bernanke in a November 2010 op-ed for the Washington Post: ‘Lower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.’34 In effect, the Fed was using monetary policy to power the ‘New Wealth Machine’.

In the late 1980s, most Japanese policymakers believed that the ‘bubble economy’ and real economy were two separate entities and that the former could be deflated without damaging the latter.36 After the Nikkei turned down in 1990, a senior official told the Washington Post: ‘it’s time for the bubble to burst … the real, productive economy won’t really be hurt. Land and people won’t disappear, but phony wealth will.’37 This was a delusion. Japanese companies that had engaged in zaitech (financial engineering), making leveraged bets on stocks and real estate, faced large losses after the property market’s collapse. Too much ‘real’ economic activity depended on the ‘phony wealth’ created by the Bubble Economy.

America’s own bubble economy took off as Japan’s deflated. After the turn of the millennium, millions of blue-collar jobs were killed off by Chinese imports. Container ships leaving the Port of Los Angeles crossed the Pacific laden, not with American exports, but with garbage to be dumped in the Far East. By 2008, just one in ten US workers was employed in industry. The US economy was slowly financialized. Before the financial crisis most newly created jobs were in construction or services, such as banking, that benefited from the real estate and credit boom. The output of the finance, insurance and real estate sectors (FIRE) rose to be 50 per cent larger than manufacturing. The country possessed more estate agents than farmers.38 The global financial crisis didn’t kill off financialization but rather accelerated it. In the aftermath of Lehman’s bankruptcy, finance contributed an even larger share of US economic growth than before.39 As we have seen, ultra-low interest rates facilitated corporate mergers and borrowing, thereby boosting Wall Street’s income. Inflated asset prices raised the incomes of hedge fund managers and other asset managers.40 Rather than investing in real assets, companies used debt to buy back their shares. The finance sector’s share of the economic pie grew to roughly three times its historic average. As one commentator observed: ‘We’ve substituted finance for industry as the locomotive of economic growth. In GDP terms, it looks terrific. But it is neither enduring nor real.’41

The Cyrenaics thought that the only thing that matters is immediate physical pleasure, here and now. However, they came up with practices that allow us to own our pleasures instead of our pleasures owning us, thus attempting to bypass the hedonic treadmill. The Epicureans, by contrast, deployed a more sophisticated analysis according to which absence of pain is the real prize since it generates a smooth, calm mental pleasure that is far more desirable than any trifling joy physical pleasure may bring.

Reading about the housing crisis now, it would be easy to reach the conclusion that ‘commodification’ and ‘financialisation’ were invented around 2008. Some memories stretch further back, as far as the 1980s and the national ‘right to buy’ scheme. Looking back at the long development of land rights, however, it becomes clear that this perspective ignores the sophisticated history of property speculation that has unfolded since the seventeenth century.

True enough, all land is technically still owned by the Crown, and some wealthy landowners still hold noble titles. Indeed, some landholdings date back to the Norman Conquest. But the modern system of landownership in Britain is absolutely an expression of capitalist social and economic relations, and needs to be understood as such. Although the Crown may own the land, the modern state is not only subject to powerful legal restrictions, but has also developed its own deep ideological commitment to private property rights.

the development of agrarian land rights and practices also had knock-on effects on housing. As the value of domestic agriculture went into decline, largely due to the successes of colonialism in producing wealth abroad, and as the mass of working people became increasingly large, urban and propertyless, the importance of the housing aspect of land rights increased. Increasing amounts of both land and people were encompassed by the principles of commodification.

this historical chapter seeks to establish three things. First, it is important to note that the capitalist treatment of land is in fact a regime with deep historical roots, rather than an innovation of the twenty-first century. Second, the near-death of private landlordism in the twentieth century shows how tantalisingly close we came to achieving a better world. Third, the more recent policy history shows us how deep-set are the causes of the failure to produce effective ideas for tackling the housing crisis:

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in many parts of the country, building homes was a criminal offence. That was because, until the Stuart Restoration in 1660, the rather crude assumption was that the government could curb population growth simply by refusing to allow sufficient accommodation to exist.

Various laws and royal proclamations prohibited the laying of any new foundations within three miles of London’s city walls, as well as banning the subdivision of existing homes within that city. At the same time, across the country it was illegal to build cottages anywhere unless they had a minimum of four acres to support them.

under the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660, also known as the Statute of Tenures, that parliament abolished the various ancient service-based forms of rent that had persisted throughout feudalism, replacing them with a more standardised and straightforwardly financial obligation payable by tenants to landowners. The aim of the statute was to do away with the king’s right to raise funds through feudal obligations, bypassing the need for parliamentary taxation, Charles I’s abuse of which had been one of the proximate causes of the Civil War. With this parliamentarian reform, a modern system of for-profit development began to take shape on former manorial lands, and speculation began to take hold.

The new model of housing production typically involved an urban square being laid out, sometimes with a small market to compensate for the distance from the established city, and the homes around it being marketed to the highest-possible calibre of householder. The proceeds from the sales then financed the construction of the developer’s own grand home on the site. Number 10 Downing Street itself – now the seat of the British government – was part of a speculative scheme of the 1680s built by the property developer and Civil War turncoat Sir John Downing.

The manorial lands to the north and west of London – in places like Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Bloomsbury – were viable for development because their ownership tended to be structured through a still-recognisable system of ‘freehold’ and ‘leasehold’. Leasehold was a medieval innovation that had in effect led to the invention of the very concept of the landlord: a leasehold was, as it remains, a legally recognised and protected right that allowed its owner (the tenant) to make use of the land while the freeholder (landlord) was able to exploit the profits at one remove. By the seventeenth century, this well-established system had evolved to allow landowners to grant building leases, so that the financial risks of building could be passed down the chain to property developers, while the landowner’s investment matured over time.

At the same time, however, London’s eastern suburbs – such as the manors of Stepney and Hackney – were held under a semi-feudal ‘copyhold’ system of short leases that incorporated an ungodly jumble of local customary obligations.

London had exploded to become Europe’s largest city, and by the mid nineteenth century England’s proportion of city-dwellers (more than 40 per cent) dwarfed that of France (14.4 per cent) and Germany (10.8 per cent).4 This massive urban population was a very significant new source of rental income:

It was not until the nineteenth century that a sophisticated system emerged of rent extraction by a class of middlemen who did not themselves own the land. Housing in the nineteenth century ‘reached the ultimate consumer, often enough, only through a maze of intermediate leases and subleases between the ground landlord and the tenant’.6 The Victorians had discovered a new profession: that of the rentier.

‘mortmain’, an ancient legal principle that prohibited corporations from obtaining land, as they would never pass it on through death and inheritance. Mortmain had been established under thirteenth- and sixteenth-century statutes, and was aimed at preventing the monasteries from owning land in perpetuity. The laws prevented corporations from owning land without a royal licence, and remained in force (and largely intact) until the very end of the nineteenth century. So while the railway developers, international trading houses and all sorts of industrialists were making use of the risk-reducing effects of company structures, land tended to be owned by natural persons.

Then, as now, the mere existence of plenty of housing was an inadequate tonic for the ills that occur when landlords are free to find the limits of people’s means. The state’s attempts to deal with the resulting slums played straight into the landlords’ hands: the generous remuneration for slum demolitions was based on the rentable value of the land, which induced many landlords to exaggerate or even intensify their overcrowding and rack-renting activities.

Shortly after the great housing crisis of the 1880s, there followed another, just as severe but entirely different in form. The 1880s had seen badly paid tenants paying well over the odds to live in squalor while there was plenty of housing to go around, simply because landlords could charge whatever they wanted. But the crisis in 1898–1902 was founded on a boom rather than on hardship. High employment and buoyant wages were causing many households to abandon cramped, shared accommodation and look for somewhere of their own. They sought to escape the overcrowded tenements, or to upgrade their living situations in various other ways, but by this point there was simply not enough housing to go around.12 The Fabians published a tract with the entirely appropriate name of The Housing Famine and How to Relieve It. It contains exactly the sort of commentary many would tend to reproduce today – though that reflects an ignorance of the fact that the present crisis is not of the 1900-type, but is instead similar to 1885: an adequate number of homes exist, but they are too expensive for many people to access under the economic circumstances of the day. It is very difficult to cast the 2020s as a 1900-style crisis of generalised affluence and housing shortage after more than a decade of stagnating wages and austerity, and an ever-increasing ratio of dwellings to households.

This was not conducive to the swift and easy commodification of new housing sites, and various acts of parliament sought to phase the copyhold system out – for the benefit of property speculators. Freehold and leasehold offered much more fertile soil in which the seeds sown by housing developers could grow as the land surrounding industrialising towns and cities shot up in value. Thus, the replacement of customary obligations with market-based economic rents saw ever more land subsumed under capitalist principles. The result was the boom in the ‘developer Victorian’ style of architecture (often now repurposed for marketing reasons as ‘period’ architecture) that still makes up such a great deal of the national housing stock.

Calls for the formal abolition of primogeniture – by which the ultimate ownership of land was passed down through the male first-born – and the replacement of complex deed-searching processes with a simple registration system were consistently defeated. This is why the Victorian petty entrepreneurs had had to resort to trading in tenurial rights over land in the first place, rather than in the land itself: they simply could not secure outright ownership. But their caucus became a steadily more powerful one over the course of the nineteenth century, as leaseholders sought to pursue their own policies against more aristocratic interests. They wanted to make it easier to buy and sell property rights (‘free trade in land’), and sought a legal right to convert their leasehold interests into freehold ones.

Leasehold remained the driving force behind acts of creative destruction throughout the nineteenth century: when long leases expired, the land reverted back to the freeholder. The freeholder then tended to knock everything down and redevelop the land, which was a major problem for both the leaseholder (who was removed from the picture entirely at the end of the lease) and the occupiers (who were forced out when their homes were destroyed).

it was not until the twentieth century that leasehold owners won the legal right to extend leases or compulsorily purchase the freehold. Bizarrely, this legislation led to a legal challenge brought by the Duke of Westminster, who took a case to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that the forced sale of housing on his land in Belgravia to its leasehold owners was a breach of his right to respect for property. The Duke lost in Strasbourg, and the domestic law on leasehold enfranchisement still stands. British capitalism evolved not by expropriating land from aristocratic interests, but by increasing the relative power and extractive capacity of subsidiary and tenurial interests.

During the 1970s a consensus emerged that the private rented sector was dying. Between 1972 and 1973 alone, privately let homes fell from 16 per cent of dwellings to 13 per cent, having stood at 61 per cent at the end of the Second World War. It seemed inevitable that the downward trajectory would not just continue, but accelerate. The story of social housing is now relatively well known. In the first half of the twentieth century the Victorian dread of state-funded housing was overcome, municipal socialism emerged, and a political consensus was eventually reached among politicians of all stripes, who fell over themselves to promise more council homes. It is important not to be misty-eyed about the heyday of social housing, and to acknowledge its imperfections even when looking back at it from the apocalyptic environment of the present. Equally, however, it is difficult to overstate the significance of mid-century housing policies for the political economy of land. The taking of large amounts of urban land into public control, and the removal of millions of people from private renting, was a hugely significant achievement. David Madden and Peter Marcuse describe the ‘partially decommodified character’ of twentieth-century housing policy, under which housing was ‘established as a social right, and state-owned housing sectors accounted for most or all residential growth’. Slum-clearance schemes and the enforcement of obligations to provide social housing for the homeless made the Dickensian era seem ever more distant.

While it is often pointed out that the private rented sector was much smaller before Thatcher came to power, what tends to be forgotten is just how close we came to abolishing landlordism altogether, and just how recently. The knock-on effect of this partial decommodification was to break the economic power of rent-seekers and land speculators, who almost did not recover from the shock. In 1973 a group

As interest rates reached 12 per cent and rent controls ensured ever-smaller yields, landlordism made little financial sense. Regulatory changes were making it less lucrative to let out cheaper homes than more expensive ones, and many of those who could not cater to the small class of better-heeled tenants were selling up entirely. With Labour councils championing the further expansion of social housing, on the one hand, while Tory governments privileged homeownership policies (such as tax breaks and the building society movement) on the other, both parties’ philosophies tended towards curbing private lettings. The result was that rentiers had few political friends.

There was a powerful constituency in favour of ‘municipalisation’, whereby distressed landlords were encouraged to sell to local authorities that would take over the tenancies as council housing. With landlords desperate to sell, and councils having access to preferential loan arrangements and grants, there was not even a need for compulsory purchase, and social housing stocks were able to grow cheaply, sustainably, and without a single new brick being laid.

when we come across opponents of rent controls, it is worth considering that, by twentieth-century standards, it is they who would have been the ones with outlandish policy demands – the extremists, the profiteers, the landlord apologists, who believed in an economy that involved skimming as much passive income from people’s wages as was humanly possible. If they do not believe in rent controls, they believe that rents should be set by the market, which (in the context of urban housing) tends to mean monopoly prices. They believe in a mechanism that necessitates poverty, and by which the already-wealthy thrive on other people’s money. By anyone else’s standards, the world is better off without landlords.

The Conservatives had begun to pursue the idea of ‘shorthold’ tenancies within months of Thatcher becoming leader of the opposition in 1975. At the time it seemed to them to be a fairly benign policy, designed to make it easier to let empty inner-city flats. But that was because it was originally supposed to operate in a context of rent controls, and in combination with a steady increase in the amount of council housing.20 It was as that surrounding policy environment fundamentally changed over the next few decades that shorthold tenure took on its socially devastating character.

a secret Cabinet memorandum written in 1963, Enoch Powell set out his belief that the government ought to play a very limited role in housing provision. Central government, he recognised, laid no bricks; but in his view the task of the state ought merely to be to control some of the economic impetuses that result in housebuilding. ‘Within limits’, he said ‘we can cajole them into building more.’21 This view was unorthodox in the heyday of council-house building, during a period of consensus in favour of the price-suppressing effects of rent controls. But by the start of the 1980s it had become foundational to government thinking, and has remained with us ever since. A high-profile 1985 Parliamentary Inquiry into British Housing concluded that physical conditions were poor, and that it was crucial that private capital be attracted into the sector – mainly by boosting the private rented sector. Housing was now all about supply, and the role of the state was merely to cajole builders by ensuring that it would be profitable to produce new homes.

The deregulation of the private rented sector lifted the lid on a buoyant housing market that had been artificially constrained for decades. The phasing-out of rent controls and the gradual withdrawal of social housing reintroduced an essentially Victorian environment in which rentiers and speculators were again free to explore the limits of tenants’ means. Not much has changed about the physical environment – we continue to live in many of the exact same buildings; but the cost of occupying those homes has skyrocketed. And while an unfathomable amount of government policy has been introduced and mooted in the intervening decades, none of it begins to challenge the logic of ‘full commodification’. Everything is focused on the circulation of housing: keeping prices as high as possible as an indirect means of procuring new homes. But this necessarily involves maintaining the profitability of land, and therefore none of these policies has been able to work.

John Prescott’s ‘Pathfinder’ project, launched in 2003. In a scheme calculated to give economists bad dreams, the idea was that the government might tackle ‘failing housing markets’ by refurbishing – or even demolishing and rebuilding – homes in areas where nobody wanted to live. This, it was thought, might revive flagging areas and regions. But even the earliest capitalists knew that demand for housing sites is driven by their proximity to prosperity, and not the other way around. Some of the very areas of the Midlands where the Pathfinder scheme was implemented had provided the first demonstrations of that fact, as the land around places like Birmingham shot up in value as nearby towns and cities industrialised. New Labour seemed to think not only that the tail could wag the dog, but that rising housing costs were an unambiguously worthy objective.24

HMRC estimates that there are more than 2.5 million landlords in the country.2 That means that roughly one in every twenty-six people is a landlord, or one in every twenty-one adults. There are four times as many landlords as teachers. There are nearly twice as many landlords as there are employees of NHS England – the country’s largest employer. When I was born, at the tail-end of the Thatcher years, there were about 600,000, which means that an additional 2 million landlords have been created over the course of my lifetime.

The cleverest leaders of the ruling class have always directed their efforts towards increasing the number of small property owners in order to build an army for themselves against the proletariat. The bourgeois revolutions of the last century divided up the big estates of the nobility and the church into small allotments, just as the Spanish republicans propose to do today with the still existing large estates, and created thereby a class of small landowners which has since become the most reactionary element in society and a permanent hindrance to the revolutionary movement of the urban proletariat. Napoleon III aimed at creating a similar class in the towns by reducing the denominations of the individual bonds of the public debt, and M. Dollfus and his colleagues sought to stifle all revolutionary spirit in their workers by selling them small dwellings to be paid for in annual instalments, and at the same time to chain the workers by this property to the factory once they worked in it.

The idea, which reached new heights under Thatcherism, is that admitting a greater number of people into the club of landownership convinces them of the need to preserve the sanctity of private property in general, and thus of capitalism more broadly. But what was new about Thatcherism – what distinguished it from the ideology of the nineteenth and even the eighteenth century – was that it did not simply enhance the ordinary person’s ability to own their own home, but also made it much easier to own other people’s homes. When the Thatcher, Major and Blair governments rescued the private rented sector from its death throes, they did so by creating the conditions for a multiple-property-owning-democracy. They created a new cadre of millions of little rentiers – a whole class, a whole generation, of Thatcher’s landlords. Unlike in most wealthy countries, privately rented housing in Britain is overwhelmingly owned by individuals rather than corporate landlords. Data from the English Private Landlord Survey in 2021 showed that a full 94 per cent of landlords in England were private individuals rather than companies, almost half of them owning just one rented property, and a further 39 per cent owning four or fewer. The rental market is dominated by millions of small-time side-hustlers with an average age of fifty-eight, rather than by real-estate capital. This is not to say that the private rented sector is not big business. On the contrary, it is estimated that a total of £63 billion was paid in rent in the UK in 2022, dwarfing industrial sectors like agriculture and pharmaceuticals.9 This vast section of the national economy, instead of being governed by ‘captains of industry’ and high-level executives, is stewarded by more than 2.5 million individuals who are almost wholly unregulated by the state.

Almost no new homes were built for the specific purpose of providing lower-income people with private rented accommodation in the post-war period, given the rent controls that prevailed until the very late 1980s – although some private homes were built for owner-occupation. In fact, returns on working-class renting were so poor at mid-century that one of the few corporate landlords that was building flats in London in the early 1960s redeveloped a mixed-use site in west London with the intention of selling the flats to the council at cost, and making a profit from the shops alone.13 Throughout the twentieth century, landlordism (like landownership in general) was increasingly the preoccupation of individuals. Needless to say, this fact has shaped political and social attitudes towards the regulation of housing up to the present.

The case that the Conservatives made to the public in the 1950s was that de-control might ultimately lead to reduced rents – notwithstanding the Conservative Research Department’s analysis, which suggested that just 6.5 per cent of income was spent on rents at the time (read it and weep).15 But, apart from a couple of zealous pro-landlord members of the Tories’ hard-right ‘Bow Group’, the movement to liberalise the rental sector in the 1950s was mainly driven by a real concern that rents had become so impossibly low that landlords – by then, as we have seen, mostly individuals – could not afford to carry out repairs, and that housing conditions were declining as a result.

Virtually everyone who bought property from the 1980s onwards, when the average-aged landlords of today would have been in their early twenties, saw the value of their asset rise dramatically, as residential land prices slipped the leash of the rent controls that had restrained them since the Second World War. This gave all homeowners a very useful source of stability and wealth as the country’s economy radically changed under neoliberalism: a steady source of passive income and asset growth compensated for an increasingly insecure jobs market and wage stagnation, and for the slow dismantling of pensions, social care and adequate welfare provision.18 This trend also formed part of a wider shift away from an industrial economy and towards an assets- and services-based one. Inspired by an ideology known as ‘asset-based welfare’, the principle was that the fruits of land speculation were not to be hoarded by a landed elite, but shared among a growing number of middle- and working-class homeowners.

assuming it is correct that rising land values are largely derived from the rentable value of property – the regime it presupposes is something of a zero-sum game. The whole system of inflating housing assets is predicated on the existence of a strong and profitable rented sector.

those who owned or bought property from the late 1980s onwards were the beneficiaries of the assured shorthold tenancy regime, which allows rents and house prices to rise extraordinarily quickly. These tenancies became the default setting through a law passed in 1996, and in that same year buy-to-let mortgages became available.

Quantitative easing and very low interest rates ensured that housing was a relatively safe haven for capital investment, and money continued to pour in. The ‘Help to Buy’ scheme was ostensibly a form of assistance for first-time buyers, but in reality it merely served to keep house prices buoyant.

The availability of this cheap credit to everyday people, with loans assessed on the rentable value of the property, maintained the situation that individuals with relatively little cash, rather than big real-estate companies, could continue to dominate the rental market. Buy-to-let mortgages grew quickly in popularity from 2000 onwards: over the next fifteen years, the number of privately rented homes grew by 125 per cent.

The irony, of course, is that the generation that did benefit from the rentier-driven boom in housing wealth did not in fact need the financial support that ‘asset-based welfare’ was intended to provide. Baby boomers benefited from a rise in living standards over the course of their working-age lives that succeeding generations found to be not just absent, but driven into reverse. A 2022 report from the Resolution Foundation pointed out that wages typically increased by 33 per cent every decade between 1970 and 2007 – but since 2007 they have not grown at all. This means that ‘8 million younger Brits have never worked in an economy that has sustained rising average wages’.25 These younger generations have also seen the dismantling of pensions, the increasing privatisation of the NHS, the failure of the social care system, and the hollowing out of public services under austerity and inflation shocks – and, as they grew older, homes had become so valuable that ‘generation rent’ was priced out of buying its own personal welfare system. Even the younger people who are able

older owner-occupiers, who bought cheap and have paid off their mortgages, will be much better off than younger buyers facing rising interest rates and falling property prices. The implementation of asset-based welfare was initiated at the wrong time to achieve its stated aims: one generation won twice, while another lost twice.

virtually every landlord who is not making a loss is not just profiting at the tenant’s expense, but doing so three times over. First, there is the rental profit, of course (anything that exceeds the costs of servicing the mortgage and upkeep). Second, the tenant is paying off the landlord’s debt by gradually buying the landlord’s asset for them. And, third, under the conditions that have prevailed over the last forty years, the property is gaining an astonishing amount of value. In fact, capital gains are so fruitful that the very act of ownership generates more wealth than the average income: the average house price increased by £31,000 per annum in 2020–21, while median household income stood at £29,000.26

many landlords abdicate any form of labour altogether by hiring lettings agents at the cost of a portion of their profits. Landlords may think they work hard – but not nearly as hard as the average tenant has to in order to pay the rent. Some even make the mistake of thinking that landlords provide homes, rather than buying the homes that already exist and leasing them out for profit.

Brett Christophers reminds us in Rentier Capitalism, it is easy to fall into the trap of moralising about landlords’ ‘unearned’ income, arguing that it somehow undermines the dignity of productive labour. Capital exploits our need for wages; landlords exploit our need for shelter. It is odd to be more incensed by one than the other.

Following the deregulation of private tenancies in the 1980s, social attitudes softened. With such a large section of society taking part, playing the property market could not possibly be the avaricious and base activity of the popular imagination. The buy-to-let boom saw the invention of ‘dinner party landlords’: respectable middle-class people who were exploiting people’s housing need as a sideline rather than their main job, and could talk about their hobby without disgrace. Their handsome profits were, after all, gained with the blessing of the law. Popular culture also played its part. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the daytime TV schedules – and even some prime-time slots – were filled with endless property programmes, which no doubt still constitute a mainstay of social consciousness.

Nor is Britain’s situation similar to, say, that of Madrid, Barcelona or Berlin, where there is increasing concern about housing estates in local neighbourhoods being directly controlled by high finance. Instead, landlords are deeply integrated into everyday society. This social intimacy affects societal attitudes towards landlords as a class. It tempers the sense of class conflict and disguises the extractive and exploitative nature of landlordism. It is difficult to imagine a serious project of decommodification, let alone more ambitious ideas like the expropriation of buy-to-lets for social housing, when so many people’s perception of the average landlord is that they are just someone’s aunt. ‘Do you know … what the trees say when the axe comes into the forest?’ asked John Berger in his novel Once in Europa. ‘When the axe comes into the forest, the trees say: “Look! The handle is one of us!”’

the nature of the conflict between homeowners’ and renters’ interests is unusual in Britain, and underlies a serious social unease. The housing question is not class conflict in the usual sense – between the ranks of working people on one hand and capital on the other – but rather a state of civil war. Younger people are pitted against their own parents. Workers who rent, and thus need housing costs to stay as low as possible, are completely at odds with their homeowner colleagues, who delight in the rising value of their asset.

deep embedding of rentiers within society means that we have to pursue two contradictory economic and social aims at the same time. The state cannot fail the homeowning class, given that it has deliberately fostered a culture of dependency on passive income to replace pensions, wages and social services. At the same time, the state absolutely must fail them if it intends to do anything meaningful about the crisis of housing affordability.

When Marx wrote about landowners as one of the ‘three great classes in society’ – the others being the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the working class – he had in mind the great institutional rentiers of earlier centuries: the Church, the Crown, landed estates. While, in some parts of the modern world, this landowning class has come to be replaced by a somewhat coherent group of rentier institutions (corporate landlords, mortgage lenders and institutional investors), landlordism in Britain is distributed among 2.5 million fairly ordinary people. These landlords’ interests are aligned with those of the nearly 15 million owner-occupiers whose prosperity relies on property, and therefore on a strong rental market.

Where homeowners have grown-up children who rent, there is an obvious internal division between the policies that would serve those two generations. But each side – the parents and the children – are themselves conflicted internally, too. From the parents’ perspective, their own wealth – and their children’s inheritance – must be maintained; but equally they must surely loathe a system that causes their children to spend such a great deal of money on poor-quality rented housing, and locked out of homeownership. From the children’s perspective this experience is reversed: they have a clear interest in ending the system of price rises that keeps them trapped in the renting system, but they would presumably dread to see their parents’ financial security for later life come to harm. The creation of a large petty-bourgeois rentier class – a whole generation dependent on housing wealth – means that the civil war over housing policy is fought between parents and children, between neighbours and colleagues, and, as Chapter 4 will explore, between regions of the country.

Marx would argue that there is an economic impetus to raise rents. Housing – like all financial investments – has to generate a yield that corresponds to its speculative value. Landlords need to be able to show that the purchase price of housing is justified, and the idea of ever-increasing rents is baked into that purchase price. Landlords will have bought homes – or will intend to sell them – at a price that assumes ever-rising rents, and the actual rent charged will need to correspond to the value of the property. Just as land in general requires the existence of rent to justify its value, a buoyant property market like ours requires rents to rise perpetually.

And generation rentier is, of course, funded by generation rent. It is younger and poorer people who maintain the value of homeowners’ assets by paying the rent. While many have written about the massive transfer of wealth that will one day occur when the current generation of homeowners dies, passing on their property through inheritance, perhaps the more important point is this long-standing transfer of wealth from younger renters to the older generation. It is tenants who have been underwriting housing values, and thereby paying for the pensions and later-life welfare of generation rentier. The question, as renters’ living standards continue to fall, is whether and for how long this situation is sustainable.

In 1960s Britain, when 27 per cent of metropolitan landlords openly barred black and brown tenants and just 6 per cent welcomed them, many migrants and racialised people sought to buy property as a means of achieving housing security and avoiding a ‘colour tax’ in the form of higher rents for lower-quality housing.11 A 1965 government report documents both the South Asian and black Caribbean communities setting up community lottery schemes to finance homeownership. Members would buy in, and each month or fortnight a member would ‘win’ and be awarded the whole amount that had been raised. This might pay for the initial deposit, or possibly even the whole house.

Black and brown first-time buyers were frequently sold a pup: homes that were due for demolition; homes that were already occupied by secure sitting tenants; buildings so dilapidated that they were beyond economic repair; or simply – in the words of the government report – ‘rubbish sold dear’.12 Sellers either exploited recent migrants’ lack of awareness about the idiosyncrasies of property-buying, or lied to them outright. Mortgage lenders, too, saw an opportunity for profit, targeting low-waged migrant workers with exorbitant interest rates and short-life second mortgages. These practices served only to fuel the very prejudices that had caused them in the first place. Finding that it was impossible to service the mortgages or carry out repairs, some of these cheated new homeowners resorted to the very worst forms of landlordism to avoid financial ruin. They let out rooms at high rents, overcrowded their houses, and bothered any sitting tenants either accidentally (by surrounding them with overcrowded new neighbours) or on purpose (to persuade them to leave, in order to re-let). This then created a moral panic: ‘an ingrained fear and apprehension, whether rational or irrational, inspired by the coloured landlord’.

House-price speculators are not only loath to share their neighbourhoods – they see a need actually to remove the racialised poor altogether, through gentrification, as a means of protecting or increasing the value of the asset they are concerned with. A society that bases its prosperity on homeownership, and at the same time sees an ever-increasing gap in ownership levels is practising white supremacy. Like the divide between ‘generation rent’ and ‘generation rentier’ described in Chapter 3, the entrapment of black and brown people in the private rented sector represents a perpetual transfer of wealth from the racialised poor to the class of disproportionately white homeowners. Such is the heritage of colonialism and imperialism. Property wealth was built on the successes of those projects. As British surveyor George Head put it on the eve of the First World War: ‘it is evident that any check to our supremacy in trade cannot fail to have a downward bearing on property values’.

At the most basic level, housing wealth tends to be determined by its proximity to productive capital. Where wages are higher, better rents (even monopoly rents) can be extracted, and housing values will tend to follow suit. Prices for housing land shot up, for example, in new urban sites right across the country during the industrial revolution, as towns and cities boomed and the new urban working class became trapped in the housing-commodity market.

Let’s begin with the ethics. As true hedonists, the Cyrenaics believed that the highest good in life is pleasure and that everything else is therefore subordinate to it and instrumental to its attainment. Unlike the Epicureans, however, the Cyrenaics stressed physical pleasure in the here and now, forgoing both mental pleasures and the Epicurean emphasis on remembering past pleasures and anticipating future ones. The reason for these preferences probably has to do with the fact that physical pleasures are more intense than mental ones: Pause right now and think about enjoying a gelato; now actually go out and taste one. See the difference?

Happiness itself was not the highest good for the Cyrenaics—pleasure was. The two are not the same thing, since the Cyrenaics defined happiness as being composed of past and present particular pleasures, like eating a gelato or enjoying a good swim.14 For the Epicureans, the lack of pain is what brings happiness, whereas the Cyrenaics thought that happiness is an ill-defined and probably unattainable state of being. Pleasure, by contrast, is a goal that is easy to grasp and natural to pursue.

Modern utilitarianism, originally articulated by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, says that what is moral is whatever maximizes most people’s pleasure and minimizes most people’s pain. But the Cyrenaics were not concerned with other people’s pains and pleasures, for the simple reason that we cannot experience them. All we can experience is our own pains and pleasures, and that’s what we need to focus on. That is why their philosophy is not just hedonistic but also egoistic,

Happiness for them is entirely instrumental, to be cultivated because of the pleasure that it brings to us. We hope that our friends also enjoy the pleasure of our company, but that’s their experience, which is unavailable to us and therefore not our concern. It makes no sense for a Cyrenaic to say that we should value friendship for its own sake, or that we should care about our friends regardless of the pleasure they bring us. In turn, this seems to imply the fungibility of friendships: If a friend no longer brings me pleasure, or if a new one brings me more pleasure,

it would seem that what the Cyrenaics thought about friendship applies just as well to any other relationship, despite Aristippus’s affectionate treatment of Laïs. The resulting picture may be unappealing to our modern sensitibilities but, paradoxically, may more closely resemble our actual behavior as documented by psychologists. When people use dating apps, for example, they tend to “trade up” whenever a more desirable partner comes along.15

In the Protagoras, one of the Platonic dialogues, Socrates says that current pleasures loom large and future ones small as a result of something analogous to an optical illusion: Objects in the distance appear small, but they may not actually be small at all! Accordingly, we should mindfully correct our immediate perceptions, guided by our experience and wisdom. By contrast with Socrates, the Cyrenaic bottom line was that we can we can experience pleasures only in the here and now, and that any calculation about the future is of much less concern because we cannot, now, experience future pleasures. Not only that: How do we know that what we consider pleasurable now will also be enjoyed by our future selves? As we age and accumulate experiences, what we value changes, so that we may be mistaken in thinking that twenty years down the road we will hold to the same preferences in terms of what we do or don’t find pleasurable.

The whole idea of being concerned with our future selves implies one of the fundamental concepts of Greco-Roman philosophy, that of telos, or the ultimate goal for one’s life. Later Cyrenaics actually denied that human life has a telos, arguing that it is just a succession of moments, each of which is enjoyable (or not) in its own regard.

Cyrenaics—like the Cynics (chapter 5), though for very different reasons—were unconcerned with standard morality. They thought that what most people regard as proper or improper is not the result of natural inclination (a concept popular in many other philosophies of the time) but is rooted in more or less arbitrary customs. What goes in Athens, so to speak, does not go in Corinth, and vice versa.

While ethics is concerned with answering the question “How should we live?,” epistemology attempts to answer the question “How do we know?” Clearly the two are related, because for any given ethical claim, we can reasonably ask, “And how do you know that?”

Rationalists, like Plato, think that the ultimate source of our knowledge is the human ability to think logically, as much as this is, of course, supplemented with empirical data. Plato took mathematics and geometry to be the ultimate models for how we can make progress, and those disciplines are independent of empirical evidence: The Pythagorean theorem is true regardless of whether there is any material object shaped as a triangle, because it applies to the very idea of triangles.

Why is it, exactly, that we cannot make inferences from our perceptions to the things in themselves? The Cyrenaics advanced two reasons. The first one is the relativity of perception: As we have all experienced, at least some of the time, the very same object is perceived differently by different observers.

The Cyrenaics were not just empiricists, they were radical ones. They thought that we are not licensed to infer anything about the world in itself on the basis of our sensorial data, anticipating Immanuel Kant’s eighteenth-century distinction between phenomena (the world as we perceive it) and noumena (the world as it is in itself).

Protagoras, a Sophist, would say that the sweater is both green (to me) and blue (to you) because truth is always relative to the observer. By contrast, Democritus, an Atomist, would conclude that our discordant perceptions mean that the sweater is neither green nor blue. All three of these reactions are logically consistent with the empirical data, which goes to show why epistemology is a rather difficult subject.

The second reason we can’t tell how things are in themselves from our sense data is the privacy of experience. Let’s say we agree on the color of the aforementioned sweater: We both say that it is green. How do you know that by “green” I mean the same thing you mean?

Cyrenaics can make truth statements only about their own perceptions, while for a Sophist, everyone’s perceptions are true for them. However, some of the Sophists expanded their relativism well beyond sense perception. For instance, they would say that if you think stealing is wrong, that is true for you; but someone else may think stealing is not wrong, and that is true for them. The Cyrenaics would suspend judgment about such matters, because the truthfulness or falsity of ethical judgments cannot be ascertained via the senses.

He concluded that humans are fully in charge of their own destinies, unbeholden to distant gods. He thought that the world is composed of atoms and void, just as Atomists like the philosopher Democritus had argued a generation earlier. And in the course of his reflections, Epicurus came to believe that to seek pleasure and to flee from pain is at the heart of human nature. He professed that people should withdraw from the pressures of society, avoid physical and mental pain and discomfort, and aim for a state of peace and well-being. Epicurus believed that the good life was to “live in obscurity,”6 setting aside the stress-inducing pursuits of wealth, power, influence, and fame, and he even cautioned against marriage and having children. Instead, people should focus on enjoying simple pleasures and the camaraderie of friends, without fear of death or punishment in a nonexistent afterlife.7

Epicurus said a pot of cheese would be his biggest luxury, and he advocated for a down-to-earth yet pleasurable existence. Instead of rich, expensive foods, Epicurus and his friends enjoyed cheese and bread. Rather than racing around acquiring the latest fashions, they relied on basic tunics and cloaks. Instead of debating the most recent war, they spoke calmly about the nature of the cosmos. Rather than engaging in frequent sexual relationships and marriage, they cultivated close friendships and deep conversations. Their late-night philosophy seminars were legendary.9 At the Garden, Epicurus remained cheerful and kept sharing his ideas until the end, even when riven with pain from ailments, including kidney stones, that slowly destroyed his health. True to his ideas, he was unafraid of death and passed away calmly in his bathtub, surrounded by friends, in 270 BCE.10

Epicureanism is about reaching two goals in life: aponia and ataraxia. The first means that you are in no physical distress at all. We reach aponia when we are not thirsty or hungry, nor lacking anything else that the human body requires. Ataraxia means tranquility of mind, which is achieved when we no longer have fears, unfulfilled desires, or any of the mental states that otherwise disturb us.

Epicurean philosophy identifies three kinds of desires: natural and necessary, natural but not necessary, and unnatural and unnecessary. The first category is satisfied by things like the acquisition of clothing, shelter, food, and water. The desire we have for these things is natural, meaning that we seek them instinctively, without having to justify why or think too much about it. This desire is also necessary, because without clothes, shelter, food, and water we’d be dead or lead a very uncomfortable life. The good news is that such needs are also easy to satisfy, all things considered. The second category—desires that are natural but not necessary—is in a sense an elaboration of the first group. Consider things such as designer clothes, gourmet meals, fancy wine, and a large house. Desiring these is natural because they are the same types of items we have already encountered in the first group, and they are still about satisfying basic human needs. But they are unnecessary because those desires can be met by simpler versions of the same things. The problem with this second group of desires is that they are more difficult to procure, and hence potentially undermine our happiness, because we suffer pain whenever we can’t get them. The last category—desires that are both unnecessary and unnatural—is the most troublesome. These include such things as fame and wealth, which are inherently limitless. Once we start accumulating money and possessions there is no logical stopping point. We want more and more. Once we start caring about what some people think of us then we want an increasing number of people to admire us, or simply to “like” our posts on social media. Because these desires are open-ended, they will constantly cause us pain—the pain of not having enough wealth or enough fame, because there is no such thing as “enough” of this category of things.

Epicureans realized that some pleasures are dynamic (kinetic) and others are static (katastematic), and that the static ones are more valuable than the dynamic ones. A dynamic pleasure can be physical or mental—for instance, the pleasure of satisfying your hunger with good food, or the joy you may experience at seeing an old friend.

U.S. public companies that aim to preserve their independent existence have to show at least the promise of producing high enough returns on capital to keep the support of their investors. Otherwise, their managements and boards run the risk of being supplanted by investors and management teams armed with the conviction that they can do a better job—and willing to back their claim by paying a significant premium over the company’s market value for the right to try.

enlightened value maximization means devoting sufficient corporate time and resources to all important stakeholder groups that can affect the efficiency and long-run value of the firm. Among such groups are the usual suspects: a company’s customers and employees, for sure, and also its creditors and suppliers. But in a somewhat new twist (at least for financial economists), management also now had to take more serious account of both the environment and local communities as well as legislators, regulators, tax collectors, and other representatives of the “public interest.”

The old division of the world into two power blocs, East and West, has subsided. Now the big challenge and threat is the gap in wealth and health that separates rich and poor. These are often styled North and South, because the division is geographic; but a more accurate signifier would be the West and the Rest, because the division is also historic. Here is the greatest single problem and danger facing the world of the Third Millennium. The only other worry that comes close is environmental deterioration, and the two are intimately connected, indeed are one. They are one because wealth entails not only consumption but also waste, not only production but also destruction. It is this waste and destruction, which has increased enormously with output and income, that threatens the space we live and move in

one of two schools. Some see Western wealth and dominion as the triumph of good over bad. The Europeans, they say, were smarter, better organized, harder working; the others were ignorant, arrogant, lazy, backward, superstitious. Others invert the categories: The Europeans, they say, were aggressive, ruthless, greedy, unscrupulous, hypocritical; their victims were happy, innocent, weak— waiting victims and hence thoroughly victimized

Note that my assumption of the ultimate advantage and beneficence of scientific knowledge and technological capability is today under sharp attack, even in the Academy. The reasons for this reaction, often couched in preferences for feeling over knowing, range from disappointment at Paradise Unfound to fear and resentment by laymen of unknowable knowledge.2 Some of the anti's are millenarians: they look to an apocalyptic revolution to right wrongs and generalize happiness. Marxian Socialists and Communists, for all their lip service to science, fall in this category. Others are nostalgies, harking back to the mythic blessings of stateless, communal, primitive societies. The first group well illustrates the human limits of good intentions. The second is pissing into the wind. That is not where the world is going

the manifest asymmetry between Europe's systematic curiosity about foreign civilizations and cultures and the relative indifference of these "others" is denied a priori by apologists who unknowingly reaffirm the contrast.4 The point, say some globalists, is that there is nothing to explain. Or, if one prefers, one can "problematize" both European and non-European history by including what did not happen: "failed struggles as well as successful ones are all part of history.

Historians like to look back, not ahead. They try to understand and explain the record. Economists also want to know the past, but believe what they know about it only insofar as it accords with theory and logic; and since they have the assurance of basic principles, they are less averse to telling a future shaped by rationality

recognize the possibility of accident and unreason, but these can in the long run only delay the logically inevitable. Reason will triumph because reason pays. More is better, and in choosing goals, material achievement is the best argument. So, whereas historians are agnostics about the future, hence virtual pessimists, economists and business people tend to be optimists.7 Optimism has to do, above all, with increase of wealth, what Adam Smith called "the natural progress of opulence

Economists have not always felt this way.* Adam Smith's successors anticipated stagnation: Malthus, with his inexorable press of people on food supply; Ricardo, with his "stationary state" as land and rent soaked up the surplus; Jevons, with his bogey of fuel exhaustion. In those times, economics wore the sobriquet of "the dismal science." Subsequent progress has allayed these fears, although some see the Malthusian doom as only postponed

If we learn anything from the history of economic development, it is that culture makes all the difference. (Here Max Weber was right on.) Witness the enterprise of expatriate minorities—the Chinese in East and Southeast Asia, Indians in East Africa, Lebanese in West Africa, Jews and Calvinists throughout much of Europe, and on and on. Yet culture, in the sense of the inner values and attitudes that guide a population, frightens scholars. It has a sulfuric odor of race and inheritance, an air of immutability. In thoughtful moments, economists and social scientists recognize that this is not true, and indeed salute examples of cultural change for the better while deploring changes for the worse. But applauding or deploring implies the passivity of the viewer—an inability to use knowledge to shape people and things. The technicians would rather do: change interest and exchange rates, free up trade, alter political institutions, manage

Convergence is the watchword of the day, the promise of eventual equality, of the generalization of prosperity, health, and happiness. That, at any rate, is what economic theory tells us, assuming mobility of the factors of production. Experience is another matter. The numbers for the small set of advanced industrial countries seem to confirm convergence, but individual countries do not always stay with the pack

That's the weakness of futurism: the soothsayers do not hang around to take responsibility for their errors.

The British colony of Hong Kong is perhaps the best example of wobbling uncertainty. It went back to China on 1 July 1997. The returns are not yet in. China may choose to cherish it; or it may decide to force it into line with the mainland economy. To be sure, it seems improbable that China would kill the goose that lays so many golden eggs. But how important are Hong Kong's eggs in the larger Chinese picture? Besides, history has known similar irrationalities, and China has a history of sacrificing trade to imperial principle. Meanwhile Hong Kong business families have taken their precautions, both ways—to stay or to go. They have taken up citizenship in safer havens (some 600,000 of them hold foreign passports).1 0 They are also learning to speak Mandarin as well as their native Cantonese and replacing Western executives with Chinese.1 1 A rational "minimax" strategy: minimize maximum potential loss

We are talking here of two goals, power and wealth; and two ideals, distributive justice and impersonal efficiency. All of these hang together. Each has its own appeal, constituency, and justification. Even within the economics profession, opinions differ. The neoclassicists say no: for them, no signals more reliable than market signals. They follow here in the steps of the great master: "Great nations are never impoverished by private, though they sometimes are by public prodigality and misconduct.

Adam Smith also understood that the state can (will) do some things—defense, police—better than private enterprise. In Ottoman Turkey, firefighting was in the hand of private companies, who came running when the alarm sounded. They competed with one another and negotiated price with house owners on the spot. As the negotiation proceeded, the fire burned higher and the stakes diminished. Or spread. Neighbors had an interest in contributing to the pot. 'Twixt meanness and greed, many a house fire turned into mass conflagration

the state can be very useful as the servant of business. Officials have always been liable to temptation (bribes); that's human nature. But the growth of private salaries and bonuses in expanding economies has inflated and accelerated this venalization of government and administration. Men of money can buy men of power.

job losers are unhappy and angry, and in advanced industrial nations, job losers vote. They also demonstrate and riot. The same observers who worry about the mistakes of "strategic" trade policy might focus instead on the risks and costs of conflict. A cool economist may argue that nations do not compete as corporations do; or that loss of export markets and jobs does not make that much difference to a rich country like the United States;1 6 or that bars to imports will not promote productivity or raise the standard of living at home; or that loss of jobs in branches that are no longer "advantageous" will be compensated by the creation of other jobs in other areas. These reasonings and clevernesses will not help workers and unions intimidated by the threat of job emigration. Nor will they console someone who loses a place and must take something less satisfying and less well paid, or who is of that twilight age that makes the very idea of starting over impractical.

would simply argue here, from the historical record, that —The gains from trade are unequal. As history has shown, some countries will do much better than others. The primary reason is that comparative advantage is not the same for all, and that some activities are more lucrative and productive than others. (A dollar is not a dollar is not a dollar.) They require and yield greater gains in knowledge and know-how, within and without. —The export and import of jobs is not the same as trade in commodities. The two may be fungible in theory, but the human impact is very different. —Comparative advantage is not fixed, and it can move for or against. —It always helps to attend and respond to the market. But just because markets give signals does not mean that people will respond timely or well. Some people do this better than others, and culture can make all the difference. —Some people find it easier and more agreeable to take than to make. This temptation marks all societies, and only moral training and vigilance can hold it in check

History tells us that the most successful cures for poverty come from within. Foreign aid can help, but like windfall wealth, can also hurt. It can discourage effort and plant a crippling sense of incapacity. As the African saying has it, "The hand that receives is always under the one that gives."2 0 N o , what counts is work, thrift, honesty, patience, tenacity. To people haunted by misery and hunger, that may add up to selfish indifference. But at bottom, no empowerment is so effective as self-empowerment

the rich, industrial countries can defend themselves (ease but not eliminate the pain) by remaining on the cutting edge of research, by moving into new and growing branches (creating new jobs), by learning from others, by finding the right niches, by cultivating and using ability and knowledge. They can go a long way on cruise control and safety nets, helping the losers to learn new skills, get new jobs, or just retire.

Middle East has much going for it, in particular, huge oil revenues (some $2 trillion [ 1 0 1 2 ] in the twenty years after 1973), but its political, social, and cultural institutions do not ensure security of enterprise or promote autonomous technological development.

The international experts keep their chin up (that's what they're paid for) and offer modest recipes for improvement. Thus the World Bank, with its talk of "adjustment," reminds us that good policies pay. What are good policies? Realistic, competitive exchange rates, low or no budget deficits, low or no barriers to trade, markets, markets, markets. Such "improvements in the macroeconomic framework" do help. They clear major distortions and obstacles. But they do not come easy. How does one eHminate budget deficits when half the workforce is employed by the state unproductively and political stability is tied to inefficiency?

The twentieth century divides neatiy at two points: 1914 and 1945. The first date marked the start of the so-called Great War—one of the most absurd conflicts in human history. These four years of combat left 10 million dead and many more maimed and stunted. They also took a prosperous and improving Europe and left it prostrate. The tragedy lay in the stupidity of kings, politicians, and generals who sought and misfought the conflict, and in the gullible vanity of people who thought war was a party—a kaleidoscope of handsome uniforms, masculine courage, feminine admiration, dress parades, and the lightheartedness of immortal youth.* Colonial wars should have provided a warning, but the use of repeating and automatic weapons against "savages" left the confidence of the white man intact. Still, the Boer War in South Africa, where the British took terrible casualties, should have instilled a prudent fear

statesmen and diplomats were stuck with a legacy of hatred and revenge that left litde room for reason. Could France be generous to Germany? In 1870, Germany invaded France, and after few casualties and no damage to its own territory, had used its victory to compel an extortionate indemnity. Now Germany had invaded France again, killing well over a million Frenchmen and wasting the richest industrial regions, pulling out as soon as the Allied armies threatened to move on to German land. Could France let them get away with that? How to calculate such losses? How much for vicious intentions? What if the Germans had won? And what about the home fronts? The Germans did not surrender in 1918; they concluded an armistice. They had lost, but had not admitted defeat. German (and Austrian) malcontents and chauvinists cried betrayal: we were stabbed in the back. Villains were there for the marking—Jews to begin with, also socialists, and even better, the two together. Meanwhile tsarist Russia had collapsed, first into civil war and then into a Bolshevist regime that fomented in every country a festering conflict between revolution and status quo

The political rhetoric of the day stressed the differences between socialismcommunism on the far left, fascism on the far right.

The reaction to the German threat had been slow and reluctant. How could the land of Goethe and Beethoven become a cesspool of savagery and a threat to all?* Also, after the folly of the Great War, what could possibly justify another conflict? Fatigue and fear engendered an unconditional tolerance for evil, so long as the victims were strangers and far away. Only when it became clear that Germany's appetite was growing with the eating, and when the Nazi-Soviet pact freed German's rear for aggression against the West, did the democratic governments face up to reality and declare war. They did not do well; and once Germany had taken just about all of Continental western Europe, it turned eastward against the Soviet Union, which had slept with the devil and now felt his fangs. So democratic (capitalist) and socialist countries joined against the common enemy. The West poured in supplies, played Russian songs, romanticized "Uncle J o e " Stalin and the Red Army, fought a two-front war in the Adantic and Pacific. Colonial troops helped their masters out. The Soviets did most of the dying: of a population of almost 200 million, more than one out of four was killed or wounded. (The Germans also lost heavily, but that's the price of trying to take over the world

Even before World War II was over, the cold war between the two systems had begun, or, more accurately, had resumed. In the decades that followed, Western market economies put the Great Depression and wartime losses behind them and entered a period of unprecedented growth. Much of this was due to pent-up technological innovation. France-1948, for example, after decades of economic standstill followed by war and occupation, was a tired version of France-1900. Paris, empty of vehicles, needed neither traffic lights nor one-way streets; all cars had to be garaged at night; gas stations handcranked the pumps. Many small flats and houses had electrical services as low as 3 ampères—enough for a light bulb, a radio, perhaps an electric iron; anything more would blow the fuse wire

In the next three decades—what came to be known as the trente glorieuses (the thirty wonderful years from 1945 to 1975)—France moved in with alacrity. New construction, new industrial installations, a new road network—new, new, new—all of this was an opportunity to install up-to-date facilities, to electrify and mechanize and motorize. The automobile and telephone told the story. Once seen as luxuries for the rich, they now became necessities. Whereas in 1953, only 8 percent of French workers owned a car, fourteen years later half of them did

the same people who had once sat for hours in a cafe waiting for a long-distance call to go through (and maybe drinking a litde and playing cards; the cafetier had to make a living too), now began to have home telephones. They might have to wait a year or two to get their connection. Central switchboards were swamped, particularly in Paris, and the post office, which ran the telephone service, had litde sympathy for this rival mode of communication. People renting apartments to foreign vistors made much of the fact that they already had a phone. But not only foreigners; telephones are addictive, and the French can talk with the best. In the end, P.T.T. (Postes, Telegraphs, Telephones) hived off the phone system and the government created France Telecom to deal with these matters—an indispensable first step to autonomy, initiative, and market responsiveness

Government engineers and functionaries, with and without the cooperation of private enterprise, modernized the infrastructure: roads, railroads, communications, public housing, equipment. The results exceeded expectations, and France in some areas, such as high-speed rail service, set the pace for the rest of the world. Whether such developments were always profitable is not clear; state subsidies, manifest and discreet, obscure the realities of the market. But what a pleasure for the privileged railway passenger, especially one favored by discount ticket prices (state employees, for example), to ride some of the smoothest and fastest lines in the world! France never became a giant maker of standardized industrial products. The French typically bought household machines in Germany and Italy

France remained the master of quality, making articles set above and apart by taste (in both senses) and beauty. And France, the country, remained one of the world's most beautiful places to visit, a work of natural and man-made art, a tourist paradise. By the 1990s France had one of the highest standards of living in the world, with income a quarter again as high as that of old rival Great Britain.

One sticking point, source of weakness as well as strength: the French are proud. They have their way of doing things and, unlike the British, do not take easily to loss of power. This makes them poor learners of foreign ways. They have their own way. Today, French workers enjoy a generous social safety net and excellent medical and child care, along with strong vested privileges (long paid vacations, early retirement). This, plus cultural advantages, makes France a marvelous country to grow old in. But it also makes employers slow to hire, because every hire is laden with associated costs and potential liabilities. The effect: a high unemployment rate that hits especially hard at the young

The German comeback was even more astonishing. The country had suffered heavy war damage, and much of what was left was seized by the Russians, who had good reason to make the losers pay for what they had destroyed and taken—but did not always know what to do with the machines and materials. Heaps were left to rust at roadside. Better junk than German. In 1945, Germans had stopped taking baths for lack of hot water or soap.

The years that followed were marked by hard winters, food and fuel shortages, endless cleanup of rubble, and political repair, if not retribution. And then in 1948 the new Germany issued a new currency, exchanging 1 deutsche Mark for 10 Reichsmark. Price controls came off, and hoarded stocks came out of hiding. The economy took off.1 In twenty years, the deutsche Mark, along with the Swiss franc, became the strongest currency in Europe.

As spectacular as was the German "economic miracle," the Japanese one was even more so. Destruction and casualties from American bombing were horrific, in large part owing to flammable housing and the tenacious refusal of a proud country, never defeated in war, to acknowledge its situation. Toward the end, the Americans "owned" the skies and could attack at will. Even so, it took the atom bomb to persuade the emperor and many (but even then not all) of his advisers and military to surrender.

The Japanese, like the Germans, built their recovery on work, education, determination. They too were helped by American financial assistance; here, as in Europe, the aim was to parry the perceived Russian threat. The rapidity of Japanese development was the more astonishing in that it took place without the advantages of empire. Prewar Japan had been convinced that control of raw materials was a sine qua non of power and wealth, indeed had gone to war to secure this control. Now they had lost everything and found to their surprise what the economists could have told them all along, namely, that raw materials can be delivered on competitive terms anywhere in the world. All it takes is money to buy them

Their quickness stunned Japan's competitors. Some know-how came to them because producers in other countries hired Japanese firms to make objects (watches, auto parts) that the more advanced country could label and sell as its own. Much they copied by reverse engineering, taking Western models apart and learning to make them better. They also sent missions to visit Western lands and humbly learn by watching and asking, photographing and tape-recording. "Humbly" was the word: the Japanese are the proudest of people, but that very sense of pride raises humility to an art and a virtue

Even more impressive was the Japanese ability to go beyond imitation and invent. A visit to a Japanese showroom is a look into the future: the objects look familiar, but they do new things. Their greatest success came in automobiles, an industry so voracious and varied in its appetite for materials and parts that it could act as locomotive to most of the manufacturing sector. Beyond that they set their eyes on the most advanced and demanding high-tech products: optical devices, precision machinery and instruments, robotics and electronics. Before the war, the Germans held a quasi-monopoly on high-quality cameras; names like Leica and Zeiss were legendary. At the end of the century, Leica is still there, but a good Leica camera costs three times as much as the Japanese equivalent. For rich aficionados, price does not matter. But for most users, including professional photographers, that kind of difference is prohibitive. Japan dominates the market, leaving niches to others

The disastrous experience of the thirties, when industrial nations closed doors and windows and beggared neighbors, had led most economists and politicians to recognize the advantages of free trade, not only for economic prosperity but international harmony. Sentiment along these lines was, to be sure, far from unanimous, but with the United States leading the way, diplomacy and expertise urged everyone to open up. America here was following the British precedent of a century earlier: now that it was the richest, most powerful economy in the world, it renounced old protectionist habits

In the 1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) by industrial nations was growing five times faster than world trade, ten times faster than world output; and even when these flows slowed in the 'nineties, FDI to the developing countries kept growing.5 In this way, investment and technique have cascaded from country to country, with wages rising accordingly. The Koreans moved into automobile manufacture with orders and technical assistance from American firms hard-pressed to meet Japanese competition. The Swiss and Japanese contracted for watches and parts made in Hong Kong, then in Malaysia. Japanese ( N E C , Sony), European (Philips, Rollei), and American (G.E., Seagate Technologies) multinationals have made Singapore a world center of electronics and photographies, while Hong Kong, where refugee labor could once be had for a low wage and a pallet to sleep on among the machines, is busily setting up plants and leasing work in mainland China.

the home industry, led by Toyota and Nissan, did catch fire. In 1950, Japan made 32,000 vehicles—about one and a half days of American manufacture. At that point the Korean War brought a rush of orders and gave the automobile industry an impulse that it never lost, the more so as the American occupation ended in 1952, leaving Japan free to pursue its own industrial destiny. This was that of a major exporter, not only because bigger sales meant lower unit costs and higher profits, but because greater productive capacity enhanced the power of the nation. Defeat—the first ever suffered by Japan—had left a bitter taste. The Japanese knew they had lost the war not because the Americans were better or braver fighters, but because of America's industrial output

By 1974, Japan had replaced West Germany as the world's largest exporter of automobiles. By 1980, it was shipping some 6 million vehicles, 54 percent of total output, and had passed the United States as the biggest carmaker in the world.1 7 What's more, other things equal, these Japanese cars were not winning market share by lower prices. Japanese cars actually cost more, often more than sticker price, while American cars typically sold for less than list. Why so? Because Japanese cars had fewer defects and stood up better to wear, hence sold higher on the used-car market. These growth rates of 30 and 40 percent a year in the face of immensely rich and firmly entrenched competitors will be studied in the future as a lesson in energy, ingenuity, and enterprise.

After the war, the Japanese needed new equipment, and this gave them the opportunity to imagine and combine ingenious tools and machines—most of them, ironically, made to order in the United States. It also opened the way to the latest devices—automation, robotics, computerization. The key change took the Japanese from single-purpose to multipurpose machines, which required a workforce trained to deal with a range of jobs, shifting quickly from one to the other. The Japanese did this by adapting the equipment and learning the drill, so that by the 1970s, for example, they could change dies in stamping presses in five minutes,

Where American car makers, with their long runs and rare changeovers, dreaded interruption (from strikes, for example) and accumulated a buffer of ready components, Japanese makers strove to minimize stocks by using the system we know as "just in time."* The idea, we are told, came from visits to the United States—not to the automobile plants but to the supermarkets, with their extraordinary diversity of products. They watched American housewives, who kept track and bought as needed; and the markets also kept track and did the same. The goods were pulled through rather than pushed. Why couldn't cars be made that way? (They were, in American auto plants, but the Japanese refined a procedure that had room for improvement. ) All of these ideas testify to the value of curiosity, observation, and lateral thinking; in short, to the importance of the human actor.

Most of them engage in company-sponsored activities on at least one holiday a month; a third do more than that. The company makes this easy, what with private recreational facilities, organized activities, and assiduous monitors. Ask a Japanese worker what he does, and he'll tell you the name of his company.2 7 Observers have justiy contrasted this teamwork, this sacrifice of the individual to the group, and yes, this hyperintensification of labor, to the adversarial relationship that embodies and sanctions the selfrespect of Western labor

Much of the initial failure of the American auto industry to hold its own against this bull of a competitor was its own fault—of labor partiy, because of its hormonal reluctance to change ways or give way; but of management even more. The list of sins is long: (1) complacency (we're the best, have always been the best); (2) want of empathy (did they really expect the Japanese, with their often narrow roads and left-side driving, to buy big cars with steering on the left?); (3) residual, two-faced reliance on government support (we're all for free enterprise, but how else counter official favors to the Japanese auto industry?);* and (4) a short and selfish time horizon that led American management to use respites from Japanese competition to raise prices and dividends rather than invest and improve techniques

before Western firms could sell their wares, economies that had been centralized to achieve a workers’ paradise had to be fixed. Economists like Columbia University’s Jeffrey Sachs and his former student David Lipton became consultants to the governments of the region and advised them to pursue “economic shock therapy.” Pioneered in the mid-1970s in Chile and a decade later in Bolivia, the program entailed privatization of state-owned enterprises, ending price controls, floating the currency, and liberalizing trade simultaneously and quickly. The underlying assumption was that the best path to prosperity was the application of regrettable but necessary pain on a society all at once to force lasting economic change. Advocates of this rip-off-the-bandage approach argued that gradual transitions from central planning would likely fail because the vicissitudes of politics posed a threat to drawn-out reforms. The faster the post-communist economies could plug into American-style globalization, the better.

The idea first surfaced among mid-level analysts and political appointees at Bush’s State Department, but it did not die when the president lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton in 1992. With only a residual Russian threat to Europe—at least at the time—the extension of the alliance eastward became a way for the United States and its allies to advance the political and economic transformation of Eastern and Central Europe.6 NATO would thus extend security to those countries that also embraced democracy and market economics.

Middle East seemed to defy global trends toward greater openness and prosperity. Of the eighteen countries in the region, only Israel and Turkey were democracies and they were imperfect, unable to cope with the contradictions between democratic politics and ethno-religious nationalism and ethno-nationalism, respectively. Gulf monarchies leveraged oil wealth, sparse populations, and coercion to ensure stability. Leaders in Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Morocco, and Tunisia cared less about the well-being of their vast reservoirs of poor people than they did about maintaining their grip on power.

With no peer competitor in the world and a surplus of power, Washington sought to use that power to promote positive change. And it would do so based on a set of ideas about the Middle East that was deeply appealing to Americans. These assumptions placed a premium on economic development, averred that culture did not matter, claimed that democracy did not require democrats, and understood that Israeli-Palestinian peace correlated with democracy and prosperity.

Culture does shape politics and economics. But the idea of freedom has universal appeal. Thus, we have arrived at neither the end of history nor a clash of civilizations, but a moment of immense democratic and entrepreneurial opportunity. We must not waste it. . . . Throughout the Cold War, we contained a global threat to market democracies; now we should seek to enlarge their reach, particularly in places of special significance to us. The successor to a doctrine of containment must be a strategy of enlargement—enlargement of the world’s free community of market democracies.

it was naïve to believe that the road to democratic polities in the Middle East ran through Jerusalem. It had also never been a priority of the United States to promote democracy in the region.

Over eight years, the administration pushed the peace process despite the massacre of Palestinians at dawn prayer in Hebron; waves of Palestinian terrorist attacks that took the lives of Israeli civilians on buses, cafés, and clubs; bloody IDF reprisals; the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin; and a change in the Israeli government that brought an avowed opponent of the Oslo Accords, Benjamin Netanyahu, to power. Even with the blood of innocents running in the streets, the Clinton team argued that peace would undermine extremists and that, with enough diplomacy and creativity, Netanyahu could be cajoled into accepting what he insisted he could never accept: Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The reality was just the opposite. The prospect of peace stirred Israeli and Palestinian extremists to action precisely because compromise threatened their unbending worldviews. When it came to actual negotiations, American diplomats made little headway despite considerable effort because the “peace processers” seemed to want a deal more than the recalcitrant parties.

From tiny Tunisia, popular protests radiated across the region. The uprisings claimed Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi—the longest-serving leader in the region—and Yemen’s president, Ali Abdallah Saleh. Among the most determined protesters were those in the tiny Persian Gulf country of Bahrain, where the royal family was forced to call on Saudi and Emirati troops to restore order. Of the twenty-one members of the Arab League, only Qatar and the UAE remained quiet. The Arab uprisings were extraordinary and mostly unexpected events. In the span of just a few months, analysts and government officials shifted their expectations from the continuation of what they called “authoritarian stability” to democratization.3 Consistent with his Cairo address, in which he committed the United States to supporting democratic transitions, President Obama put Washington back in the democracy-promotion business.

Instead of transitions to democracy, it was Syria and Libya that defined the Obama administration’s response to the so-called Arab Spring. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad’s military response to peaceful demonstrations against his regime produced horrifying carnage. Notwithstanding copious bloodshed, the displacement of half the Syrian population, the use of chemical weapons, and his soaring rhetoric about shaping politics in the Middle East, the president remained steadfast in his unwillingness to intervene directly to bring Assad down. This reflected the “don’t do stupid stuff” principle that was at the core of Obama’s corrective foreign policy.

In Libya, by contrast, the United States did intervene. President Obama did not, by his own admission, believe that American interests were at stake, but after agonizing debates between him and his advisors, he split the difference between his impulse to avoid military conflict in the region and a potential massacre of civilians, as Qaddafi had promised.5 This was Obama “the realist who felt bad about it,” as one of his advisors once quipped.

Why did Libyans deserve protection and not Syrians? How was it that regime change in Syria was “stupid stuff,” but it was not the same in Libya? One reason may have had to do with the fact that the United States’ NATO allies, notably France and the United Kingdom, applied significant pressure on the White House to act in Libya and there were willing participants among members of the Arab League. Also, as President Obama’s May 2011 speech indicated, the Arab uprisings also fed into the transformational impulses of the American foreign-policy community.8 At the time, there was an odd belief in Washington that, among the countries that had uprisings, Libya would be in the best position to make the transition to democracy. After Qaddafi’s long rule, this theory went, Libya’s “blank slate” would provide an opportunity to build democratic institutions where there had been none before. It was the kind of claim that had no connection to Libya’s reality, yet policymakers and analysts maintained faith in their ability to remake the world in America’s image. That is how a president who pledged to avoid being sucked into the Middle East became part of an ambitious effort to transform Libya.

With the exception of Tunisia, the countries that experienced upheaval in 2011 and 2012 were either experiencing resurgent authoritarianism or collapsing in violence when President Obama left office in early 2017. The fault, of course, lay with local and regional actors. In the years that followed the uprisings, it became clear that the American efforts to stabilize regional economies, forgive debt, support small and medium-sized enterprises, spur trade and investment, and help stand up democratic institutions made little, if any, impact.

Since the 1979 revolution that resulted in the establishment of the Islamic Republic, Iran threatened Israel across a number of dimensions, including symbolic but harmful campaigns to delegitimize the Jewish connection to Palestine and deny the Holocaust. At the same time, the Iranians have invested heavily in terrorist organizations such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hizballah that have waged war on Israel. And because Tehran made itself a central actor in the “resistance” against the United States and Israel, Israelis had reason to believe that Iran’s development of nuclear technology was an existential threat.

To supporters of the president and the deal, the choice was between either the JCPOA or war, implying that the agreement’s opponents were in favor of regime change in Iran. The fact that some of the JCPOA’s fiercest critics had been advocates of the invasion of Iraq made this a particularly potent discursive tactic. To the JCPOA’s detractors, the president was hopelessly naïve because the agreement preserved Iran’s nuclear program and thus made war more likely. In this environment, it was impossible to have a serious discussion of both the pros and cons of the JCPOA, especially if you were an ambitious Democrat or Republican. For the former, the agreement became the holy of holies; for the latter, it was the worst deal ever.

Third—and most germane to the overall themes of this book—although the agreement was nominally limited to Iran’s nuclear program, Obama and his team hoped that it would have much broader impacts on Iran’s internal politics and international behavior. Implicit in the nuclear agreement was the idea that it could mitigate the threat of conflict, diminish the incentive for mischief-making on the part of all the relevant actors, and break Iran’s isolation, leading to a regional balance so that all countries could “share” the region.

In reality, the JCPOA had the opposite of its intended effects. The Iranian regime’s legitimacy is based in part on hostility to the United States. Its leaders could not make a deal with the country they called the “Great Satan” without demonstrating their continued independence from Washington. This virtually assured that, after signing the agreement, the Iranian government would take some destabilizing action to prove they had not lost their revolutionary mojo. So the Iranians continued their support for Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hamas. Iran also provided weapons, training, and funding for Shia militant groups in Bahrain and stepped up its support for the Houthis in Yemen. In Iraq, American forces came under increasing fire from Iranian-backed militias. It is likely that the Iranians would have done much of this anyway, but it belied the notion that coming to terms with Iran through the JCPOA would bring more stability to the region. In addition, the financial relief that the agreement provided for meant more resources for Tehran to fund its proxies—both political parties and militias—throughout the region.

the view within Washington was that whatever shortcoming and opposition there was to the JCPOA, it did not matter. The working assumption in Washington was that America’s regional partners and congressional Republicans were going to have to live with the agreement because President Obama’s (more than) likely successor, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would never walk away from it. Like many of the American foreign-policy community’s assumptions about the Middle East, the belief that Clinton would become president proved to be erroneous.

They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”15 Video clips of those eight sentences have been played over and over again to the extent that they have become an indelible moment in American politics. Lost in the miasma of these racist tropes was the fact that the majority of Trump’s address was devoted to foreign policy, with particular attention to the Middle East. In addition to decrying the state of America’s relationship with China, comparing America’s manufacturing capabilities unfavorably to Japan’s, denouncing US trade policy, and highlighting the flight of American jobs to Mexico, Trump assailed Washington over the Islamic State, the civil war in Syria, the conflict in Yemen, the invasion of Iraq, and the American-Saudi codependency. By the time of Trump’s announcement, the United States had been at war in the Middle East for more than a decade. The previous June, the Islamic State had captured territory in Iraq equivalent in area to the size of the state of Maryland, compelling the Obama administration to deploy American combat forces back to the country. Syria’s civil war had contributed to instability among its neighbors and in Europe as millions of Syrians sought safety from the Assad regime. Iran continued to sow chaos in the region while the Obama administration negotiated with its leaders over Tehran’s nuclear program. From Trump’s perspective, this parlous state of affairs was the fault of America’s elites—both Democrats and Republicans—who’d gotten the United States involved in the Middle East but did not know how to withdraw, all the while wasting trillions of dollars that would be better spent at home. Revolt against American elites over the invasion of Iraq and Washington’s transformative project in the Middle East more generally would be a theme that Trump would return to at every opportunity on the campaign trail, to devastating effect.

As a candidate and as president, Trump’s boorish and peculiar style often obscured a simple but important question he was asking the experts: “Why do we do what we do?” The answer was essentially a combination of “because that is what we do” and attacks on Trump for his laziness, ignorance, and lack of seriousness.

The slogan “ending forever wars” (sometimes referred to as “endless wars”) suggests a reordering of priorities, but as a strategy it was ill-defined. The words endless and forever intimate that there is some knowable time when conflicts become forever and endless.17 Advocates don’t offer a metric, though. The idea also seems to suggest “a military intervention that failed to achieve its goals,” but that can happen relatively quickly in a conflict.18 None of this may matter at a political rally intended to harvest votes from the grievances of Americans, but without a rigorous definition, ending so-called forever wars can lead to policy failures. It did not matter much during the Trump era, however. Despite using the phrase consistently, he did not follow through on the pledge to end forever wars. In fact, during his first three years in office, the president actually deployed more forces to the Middle East than he brought home.

in May 2018, President Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA and replaced the agreement with a policy that came to be known as “maximum pressure.” Depending on who in the administration was articulating the policy—which featured enhanced sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports and Tehran’s ability to conduct business with multinational firms, among other measures—the president’s goal was either to compel Iran’s leader to sign a new deal that would be superior to the JCPOA or to facilitate the collapse of the regime. Maximum pressure did not produce a new agreement, nor did Iran’s people rise up and bring down the Islamic regime. Instead, the policy impelled the Iranians to step up their efforts to disrupt and destabilize the American-led order in the region. In Iraq, Iran’s allies often targeted American forces with rocket fire. At times, even the massive US embassy complex in Baghdad’s Green Zone came under assault. In the summer of 2019, Iran’s air-defense forces shot down an American surveillance drone operating over the Gulf and, in a 1980s redux, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps attacked five oil tankers and a bunkering ship. Then, in September, the Iranians launched a drone and missile attack on Abqaiq, the largest oil-processing facility in the world, and the Khurais oil field—both in Saudi Arabia—temporarily taking about 6 percent of global oil supply offline.

In response to the Abqaiq and Khurais attacks, President Trump broke from forty years of declared policy, committing the United States to ensuring the security of Persian Gulf oil fields. He deflected questions about any potential American response by reminding members of the press that the Iranians had attacked Saudi Arabia, not the United States. This attitude was consistent with both his campaign rhetoric and his long-standing skepticism about the American role in the Gulf. As far back as the 1980s, he had been declaring that the Saudis and others in the Gulf should pay for their protection.

On January 3, 2019, at 12:47 a.m. Baghdad time, an American MQ-9 drone—known as a Reaper—fired missiles at a Toyota sedan and a Hyundai minivan traveling together along the access road that runs to and from Baghdad International Airport. In the vehicles were Abul Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of an Iraqi terrorist group called Kataib Hizballah, and Iran’s Major General Qassem Soleimani. During the previous week, Muhandis’s forces had fired about thirty rockets at an airbase in north central Iraq, killing a contractor and injuring several American and Iraqi soldiers. Then, on New Year’s Eve, a mob under the direction of Iranian proxies had assaulted the US embassy in Baghdad, breaching its main gate. Muhandis was a valuable target. His group had been particularly lethal to American troops in Iraq, and his Iranian patrons could reliably count on him to spill blood and intimidate Iraqi officials to ensure that Tehran got its way in Baghdad. Yet Muhandis’s presence in the vehicle may have been a happy coincidence for the Pentagon and CIA because the operation’s target was Soleimani. The head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force had taken on an almost-mythic status in the Middle East. Soleimani pulled the political levers in Iraq, rescued Syria’s Bashar al-Assad from what seemed like certain defeat, helped ensure Hizballah’s vice grip on Lebanon, and took full advantage of Saudi Arabia’s ill-conceived intervention in Yemen to pin down Iran’s adversary in an unwinnable war. He had rendered four Arab capitals satellites of Tehran and seemed untouchable, slipping from one war zone to another without suffering so much as a scratch. Until, that is, President Trump brought an end to Soleimani’s bloody campaign.

American politics has become more polarized. There are many reasons for this, of course, but the Middle East seems to have played an outsize role. In a narrative that has taken hold among parts of the electorate, American elites caused significant damage to the United States in the years after the 9/11 attacks. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq squandered resources and shattered the families of those killed and wounded. When Barack Obama derided “stupid wars” and Donald Trump declared that the United States could have been rebuilt with the money spent on the Middle East, they were both speaking to disaffected Americans who had grown weary of the international social engineering projects of the political class.

In parallel to its military expeditions in the Middle East and Central Asia, the United States embarked on a massive expansion of both the reach and capabilities of its domestic-security agencies, which, with the exigencies of the global war on terror, were left unaccountable. Then, in 2008, years of irresponsible practices resulted in the failure—or near failure—of a number of investment banks, mortgage lenders, and insurance companies. The collapse of the housing market, the near destruction of the iconic American auto industry, the spike in unemployment, and the sharpest economic contraction since the Great Depression produced widespread economic and social dislocation as well as racial animus. The combination of all of these problems seemed to coalesce in Americans’ rage at elites and each other culminating in the election of Donald Trump in 2016.

There was an interesting parallel between Moscow’s advance into its neighbor and Baghdad’s takeover of Kuwait in August 1990 that Arab leaders in the Gulf should have appreciated. Like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine, Saddam Hussein rejected Kuwait’s sovereignty, calling it the “nineteenth province of Iraq.” And like the Iraqi takeover of its neighbor three decades earlier, American policymakers and their counterparts in Europe concluded that if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was allowed to stand, it would set a terrible precedent emboldening countries to use force to address their grievances, whether real or imagined.

These parallels between the summer of 1990 and the winter of early 2022 were lost on the region’s decision makers as they—especially the Saudis—leaned toward Moscow. Riyadh steadfastly refused American entreaties to pump more oil, which would have meant breaking with its partner, Russia, in what was called OPEC+ (the thirteen members of the oil cartel, plus ten nonmembers, which set targets for petroleum production and thus have significant influence on price). In the spring of 2022, the Saudi and Emirati oil ministers argued that stability of the oil market was more important than playing politics with OPEC+.16 This was a noticeable diplomatic swipe at President Biden, who would have benefited two ways from a significant increase in the amount of oil on the global market. First, the inevitable fall in the price of crude would have hurt the Russian war effort. Second, more oil would put downward pressure on the price of gasoline for American consumers. Yet the hard realities of supply and demand severely limited the Biden administration’s powers of persuasion.

The Saudis had intervened in their neighbor’s civil war against the Houthis in 2015 expecting a cakewalk, but they found themselves in a quagmire. With Iranian help, the Houthis acquired the technology to fire missiles and drones on Saudi population centers, which they did regularly. Even in light of the Houthi attacks, Biden’s team had concluded that lifting the terrorist-group designation would facilitate the flow of badly needed humanitarian aid into Yemen. It did have that effect, but it also emboldened the group. Afterward, more missiles fell on Saudi cities, as well as population centers in the UAE. At around the same time, the Biden team delisted the Houthis and removed Patriot missile batteries from Saudi Arabia as part of an effort to reduce the American military presence in the Middle East.

This account fed the suspicion among the region’s leaders that the United States supported the accumulation of Islamist power.

Middle Eastern leaders sought relations with other major powers to compensate. They did not seek to replace the United States, and there was no indication that leaders in the region sought to alter their general orientation toward America. They wanted nothing more than a partnership with the United States, but the Middle East’s crown princes, kings, presidents, and prime ministers came to question whether Washington wanted to—or even could—play the role it had previously assigned itself as the anchor of security and stability in the region.

Beijing has pursued a different track in the Middle East: investment, trade, and infrastructure development. China has become such an important economic actor in the Middle East that no US partner has been willing to choose between Washington and Beijing. For example, despite a very public American pressure campaign in 2019 to coerce Middle Eastern countries to drop the use of technology that the Chinese telecom firm Huawei developed, the company has a strong presence in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, among other places. The Chinese were also building, buying, or investing in other critical infrastructure around the region, including ports and industrial parks in the UAE, Oman, Israel, and Egypt.26 Beijing also made it difficult for American firms to compete in the region when Chinese state-owned companies often underbid on large infrastructure projects by as much as 40 percent.

The Industrial Revolution came to a world still relatively empty—at least by comparison with the population densities we know today. Within this world, of course, concentrations varied, from the thicker settlement of China, India, and parts of northwestern Europe, to the wide spaces of central Asia, Australia, and the Americas. The reasons for this variance were largely geographical and technological: populations moved to and multiplied best in favorable climes, on fertile soils, using techniques of cultivation that seized the natural potential. Political considerations also played a role. In Europe, for example, the potentially rich Danubian plain of the early eighteenth century lay quite open

withdrawn after the failed second siege of Vienna (1685). Half a century later, the Russians opened the great Ukrainian breadbasket by driving back the nomadic peoples that had roamed and vaguely ruled these wide spaces since the days of the Golden Horde (mid-thirteenth century). The biggest frontiers, however, waited overseas: the Americas above all, but also lesser spaces in Australia and southern Africa. None of these lands was empty when the Europeans arrived. Everywhere, indigenous peoples tilled the soil, raised their livestock, or just hunted and gathered. But again, densities of settlement varied, dictating the opportunity and circumstances of invasion. In the Americas, a few areas were thickly settied—the valley of Mexico, the Peruvian hill country, some Caribbean islands. Ordinarily such densities would have precluded conquest, as they did in Asia, but the technological and political weaknesses of the native American population made them vulnerable. Imported pathogens did the rest

Economists see the factors of production as land, labor, and capital. Land subsumes not only surface area but the resources that lie underneath; and from the point of view of economic development, the salient characteristics of a frontier region are space, soil, and wealth of materials. These in turn set opportunities and constraints: such lands can yield abundance of primary products per head of population, but only if they can get the necessary labor. They want people, whom they often draw by offering incentives to migration: free or cheap land in particular, but also higher wages, higher status, and political rights. (This was a crucial aspect of the improvement of status and tenure in medieval Europe.) And if voluntary labor does not come, they will import people by force, paying slave traders or recruiters to do the dirty work.

Once the factors of production assembled, frontier lands typically yield crops and other primary products far in excess of the needs of the population. These surpluses then become tradables. These economies can make so much more money producing cash crops for export than by devoting themselves to subsistence farming that it pays them to trade food security for income. (Witness the sugar islands of the Caribbean, which devoted every square inch to cane and imported victuals from as far away as Europe.

a staples theory, or "vent for surplus" argument.* The idea: one starts with earnings from export of primary products, which raise incomes at home. Higher incomes in turn promote a market for manufactures while financing the development of an industrial sector and a more balanced economy. (Much depends on the distribution of income in the staples producer. The less equal, the smaller the market for manufactures. Thus a plantation economy will not generate much industrial demand: the estate owners will buy luxury goods for themselves and spend a minimum to clothe and house their slaves.) The staples model was first put forward by Harold Innes to explain Canadian performance in terms of a succession of export staples: first furs (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), then timber (late eighteenth and nineteenth), and finally cereals (mid- and late-nineteenth century). Similar schémas have since been put forward for Sweden (timber, copper, iron), the United States (tobacco and cotton, then wheat), Australia (wool, meat, wheat), Argentina (hides, tallow, meat, grain), Meiji Japan (silk), even medieval England (wool).2 And one could conceive of parallel developments taking place in oil-producing nations today

like most good economic theories, vent for surplus models have a tautological aspect: they explain best what fits best. Just because an economy earns by export of primary products does not mean that it will then use this income well to promote development. There's the rub: invest or spend? And even if one decides to invest, who says that the money will go to the right activities? Besides, what is right? Stay with staples and maximize comparative advantage? Or aim at balanced development, that is, take less now for more later

The divergent story of North America (ex-British) on the one hand, Latin America (ex-Spanish and Portuguese) on the other, needs multiple explanation. Economists would not always have it so. For them, one good reason is enough, and where the Americas are concerned, the best reason is resources. These frontier lands abounded in natural wealth, but this wealth proved differentially useful in the context of the new industrial technologies. Here the United States came out best: large expanses of fertile, virgin land; a fine climate for growing a crucial industrial-entry raw material, namely, cotton; rich deposits of the key ingredients for ferrous metallurgy; plenty of wood and coal for fuel, plus generous waterpower all along the east coast; an abundance of petroleum, valuable from the mid-nineteenth century for light, as lubricant, and above all as fuel for internal combustion motors; copper ores in quantity, ready by the end of the nineteenth century for the burgeoning demands of electrical power, motors, and transmission. And along with this went relatively convenient lines of access and communication: a well-indented coastiine punctuated by superb harbors, large rivers (above all, the Mississippi and its affluents), and wide plains. The only serious mountain barrier between the Atiantic and the Rockies was the Appalachians, and here a number of gaps opened to trade and travel, in particular, the breach made by the Hudson River and the flat stretch to the Great Lakes. Here man was able to improve on nature, as the Erie Canal and railroads opened the Middle West to Middle Atiantic ports. In these respects, the United States was more favored than other parts of the New World. N o other country had iron and coal, for example, in proximity; no other had comparable natural ways of transport and communication. By comparison, Mexico is a puzzle of mountains, plateaus, and deserts—not without its good places but poorly joined, as railway builders found out. Much of Brazil is tropical and subtropical, so that the awesome Amazon river basin is even now penetrated with difficulty. Argentina is the country most comparable to the United States in its natural features and accessibility; but immigration there was long impeded and the key industrial raw materials are wanting. One could, then, argue, as numerous economists have, that American priority in development was predetermined by nature—the luck of the draw

explanation, one that links natural circumstances to culture and institutions.3 The argument here is that geography dictates crops and the mode of cultivation, hence the nature of land tenure and the distribution of wealth; while these in turn are critical to the pace and character of development. Where society is divided between a privileged few landowners and a large mass of poor, dependent, perhaps unfree laborers—in effect, between a school for laziness (or selfindulgence) over against a slough of despond—what the incentive to change and improve? At the top, a lofty indifference; below, the resignation of despair. Now and then, resistance breaks out and gives the elites and their soldiers opportunity to practice the martial arts; while religion offers the consolation of a better world after death. This was not the case in the northern United States, nor in Canada alongside. They had the paradoxical advantage of a climate that limited cultivation to grains and yielded little at first in the way of an exportable surplus. Economies of scale were negligible, at least before the invention of mechanical technologies, so that holdings were small, often no larger than subsistence, and more or less evenly distributed.* Such equality did not always please those of aristocratic inclinations. In 1765, a British visitor to New England, Lord Adam Gordon, frowned his disapproval: " . . . the levelling principle here, everywhere, operates strongly and takes the lead. Everybody has property, and everybody knows it."4 In addition, quasi-free land and scarce labor made for high wages and hard recruitment in both country and town, as Adam Smith observed: . . . the disproportion between the great extent of the land and the small number of the people, which commonly takes place in new colonies, makes it difficult for him [the proprietor] to get this labour. He does not, therefore, dispute about wages, but is willing to employ labour at any price. The high wages of labour encourage population. The cheapness and plenty of good land encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to pay those high wages

Farm wages and land prices, of course, set a floor for urban wages— otherwise, how hold the labor?—while the very growth of such a frontier economy pushed wages up.* Here is Smith again: It is not, accordingly, in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those which are growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are highest. England is certainly, in the present times, a much richer country than any part of North America. The wages of labour, however, are much higher in North America than in any part of England.6 America's society of smallholders and relatively well-paid workers was a seedbed of democracy and enterprise. Equality bred self-esteem, ambition, a readiness to enter and compete in the marketplace, a spirit of individualism and contentiousness. At the same time, smallholdings encouraged technical self-sufficiency and the handyman, fix-it mentality. Every farm had its workshop and anvil, its gadgets and cunning improvements.1 Ingenuity brought not only comfort and income but also status and prestige. Good workers were the envy of their neighbors, the heroes of the community. Meanwhile high wages enhanced the incentive to substitute capital for labor, machines for men.

By the time of the revolution (1770s), some two hundred iron forges were in operation in Britain's American colonies, and the annual make was some 30,000 tons. Only Britain, France, Sweden, and Russia made more. Along with smelting went refining, hammering, cutting, slitting, rolling, and the sundry other operations that turn iron into tools and objects. Inevitably, the demand for British metallurgical products fell sharply, leading British manufacturers to petition Parliament for laws prohibiting colonial manufacture

One focus of colonial industry was to cost the British dear. The colonials made guns—muskets to begin with, and increasingly rifles, which along with hunting from childhood, gave them a substantial edge in marksmanship, an edge that would persist into the twentieth century. Guns had their particular virtues in a frontier society, to the point where some of the colonies imposed an obligation to bear arms, even to church

Demand, however, did not assure supply. Culture matters. The people of the South and of backwoods Appalachia went more heavily armed, but the guns were made in the northern colonies. The reason was simple: that was where the skills and tools were. By the time the South went to war against the Union in 1861, firearms production in the North outweighed that in the Confederacy by 32 to l .

so great was the demand for weapons that long before powered machine tools became available, division of labor was enhancing productivity. The later interest of the young American republic in the mass production of small arms using interchangeable parts was anticipated well before the revolution. Thus the colonists imported and copied models of European devices and machines, and skilled machinists and craftsmen were invited

Britain boasted the most inventive society in Europe, and British immigrants felt at home in a society speaking the same language. The Germans also contributed. The Quakers of Pennsylvania had made it a point to encourage people of like faith on the European continent to join them in the New World, and these too (the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch) brought with them manual crafts and skills. By comparison, would-be-aristocratic Virginia, the nostalgic "Old Dominion," with its large plantations and indentured labor, found it hard to attract such people; and the crystallization of slavery only made matters worse

Some workers were Luddites who had fought machinery back in the old country but were ready to accept it in the New World; some, handloom weavers who had once refused to enter mills. Why the change? Like old England, New England resented the factory's strict hours and personal supervision. But whereas old England could count initially on involuntary labor—poorhouse apprentices, daughters and wives, people who could not say no—New England had to find ways to make these new jobs acceptable if not attractive. The American mills paid higher wages and gave their women and girls the kind of housing and chaste environment that reassured parents.* The paternalism of the cotton manufacturers of Lowell became legendary—the cleanly boardinghouses with their reading material and pianos, the women's own periodical (the Lowell Offering), the virtuous (sanctimonious) parietal rules.

The decisive and most distinctive American innovation, though, was not any particular device, however important, but a mode of production—what came to be called the American system of manufactures. This was a creative response to (1) a market free of the local and regional preferences and the class and status distinctions that prevailed in Europe, hence ready to accept standardized articles; and (2) the scarcity of labor relative to materials. The two were related. In a laborscarce economy, standardization was a way of dividing, hence of simplifying, tasks and making them repetitive, thus substantially enhancing productivity. But fast work tended to waste material—no time for Old World habits of trimming and thrift. In Europe, even rich merchant bankers might write their letters down the page, then turn the sheet and continue at right angles in order to save paper

Doors and windows were cut and assembled to standard size; glass, precut accordingly. (A French ship arriving in the young republic around 1815 with a cargo of window glass of various sizes was surprised to find it had to give most of it away.) Sawdust generated in the process might be recovered for other uses.2 1 Then, in the 1830s, invention of the balloon-frame house normalized and deskilled the building itself. Gone were the heavy members of traditional barns and dwellings; gone the mortiseand-tenon joints; gone the masonry and plaster walls, interior and exterior, of Old World construction.* Instead, one used precut 2x4's and nailed them together, then sheathed the frame and clapped on such facade as was practical and pleasing. The new structures were not beautiful or authentically local; but they were cheap, made use of abundant materials, and were prosaically utilitarian

Houses and buildings were only the beginning.

layout and synchrony were more important in operations such as meat slaughtering that called for disassembly rather than assembly; or where, as in flour milling and petroleum refining, higher throughput yielded major economies of scale. In all these areas of manufacture, the United States was, if not the pioneer, then the great practitioner. * From the start, the adoption of machines, in textile manufacture for example, was followed by the creation of machine shops to maintain and build the equipment; and these shops, litde worlds of assembled and interchangeable skills, often took to making other kinds of machinery: steam engines, furnaces and boilers, locomotives, above all, machine tools. These last in turn, dedicated originally to one or another special purpose, found application in diverse industrial branches

when the British, with all their industrial achievements, belatedly (mid-nineteenth century) wanted to make good and cheap muskets for military use, they sent their people to the United States to study American arsenal methods.2 7 That did not mean that the British simply junked old ways. Knowing is not doing, and Europeans in general found it harder than Americans to accept the ruthless logic of productivity. Take the doctrine of sunk costs, which says that spent money is spent, obsolete is obsolete; that just because machines will work is no reason to work them. This kind of reasoning goes against the grain, but the open frontier (robber baron) mentality accommodated it. The standard examples are Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick (the big mean): when they decided to go over from Bessemer to open-hearth steel, they just scrapped the old plant

The "American system" set standards of productivity for the rest of the industrial world. Each technology became a stepping stone to others. Clocks and guns prepared the way for watches and sewing machines. Mowers and harvesters led to sowers (planters and drills), reapers, binders, threshers, and eventually combines; bicycles, to automobiles; cash registers, to typewriters and calculators. And machines invented for one purpose slid easily to others: a sewing machine could be used on leather and canvas as well as fabric, could make boots and shoes and sails and tents as well as cloth garments. This was a mechanic's wonderland, in agriculture as in industry

agriculture became an industry too, with economies of scale, division of labor, attention to labor productivity. And to land productivity as well, though to a smaller degree: the accident of geography, the character of the new land to the west—virgin prairie, deep topsoil, water for farming, open range for animals—all ensured abundant return and meant that every movement of the frontier added substantially to the national income. Holdings were family-size, and the system of land grants and concessionary sales was designed to promote family farming. But family size could be very large and grew with the machinery; also with the appearance of specialized, itinerant teams of machine operators.

older societies did not have the tabula rasa and the optimistic, open culture that eased the task of the American farmer and manufacturer. They had to work with cramped systems of land tenure, peasants (no peasants in the United States) who scrimped on equipment to add to their holdings, great landlords who saw land more as the foundation of status and style than as capital;* and with craftsmen who saw mechanization as a personal diminution, an offense to status, a threat to jobs. The older countries had their machine-breakers; America did not. European countries also had a consumption problem. Class structures and segmented tastes made it harder there to adopt standardized products. Even so, I would stress supply rather than demand, the attitudes of producers rather than consumers. When Europeans belatedly adopted techniques of mass production, they had no trouble selling cheaper goods

American system of manufacture had created, for better or worse, a new world of insatiable consumerism, much decried by critics who feared for the souls and manners of common people. The world had long learned to live with the lavishness and indulgences of the rich and genteel; but now, for the first time in history, even ordinary folk could aspire to ownership of those hard goods—watches, clocks, bicycles, telephones, radios, domestic machines, above all, the automobile—that were seen in traditional societies as the appropriate privilege of the few. All of this was facilitated in turn by innovations in marketing: installment buying, consumer credit, catalogue sales of big as well as small items; rights of return and exchange. These were not unknown in Europe, which pioneered in some of these areas. It was the synergy that made America so productive. Mass consumption made mass production feasible and profitable; and vice versa

If the British could make and sell these things for less, delivered in New England, they did not need the prohibitions, and the colonists would have found better things to do. This is what they had found, said Smith, who without talking about comparative advantage understood and advocated the principle that resources should go to the most profitable employment: I t h a s b e e n t h e p r i n c i p a l c a u s e o f t h e r a p i d p r o g r e s s o f o u r A m e r i c a n c o l o n i e s t o w a r d s w e a l t h a n d g r e a t n e s s , t h a t a l m o s t their w h o l e c a p i t a l s h a v e h i t h e r t o b e e n e m p l o y e d in a g r i c u l t u r e .

As for the supportability of these British constraints and impositions, Smith might have rested his argument better on the inefficiency of British enforcement. The whole system was a bad joke. London was trying to impose constraints on colonial trade using a handful of agents

Latin America followed a very different pattern. It was not poorer to start with, in say the seventeenth century; on the contrary.

Gold and silver mines are wasting assets, and some two hundred years later, when the American colonists had won their freedom, North America far surpassed the lands to the south—richer in income per head, richer in its more even distribution of wealth. The only exceptions were small areas of lucrative specialty crops—specifically the sugar isles of the Caribbean; and even there only if one excludes the slave population from the data.

Where the English found a land lightly peopled and pushed the natives out of the way to make room for settler families—creating over time an absolute apartheid—the Spanish found the most densely populated parts of the New World and chose to intermarry with the inhabitants. Some see this difference as evidence of English (or Protestant) racism vs. Spanish (or Catholic) open-mindedness. Perhaps; although population distribution had its own logic* Whereas the English migrated to the northern and central colonies in families, so that except for people over sixty, the age distribution was similar to that of England, the Spanish did not encourage the emigration of families or even women to the New World.

As the native population succumbed to violence, exhaustion, despair, and above all disease, the Spanish imported black slaves from Africa. These were worked growing sugar, panning for gold, and the like, but they never played so large a role in mainland Hispanic America as on the Caribbean islands and in the southern United States. Meanwhile immigrants from other European countries were not available. In Spain itself, locals complained bitterly of the competition and pretensions of non-Spanish and non-Catholic businessmen, traders, and craftsmen. Not so in Spanish America: the crown did its best to keep these outsiders away from its possessions in the New World. This exclusion deprived the empire of badly needed skills and knowledge, to say nothing of the cultural advantages of diversity, of those quarrelsome Protestant heresies that fostered intellectual challenge and sustained an appetite for education.1 Everywhere in the Spanish colonies, moreover, the Inquisition pursued heresy, hunting those crypto-Jews who thought that an ocean would shield them from prying fanaticism. The aim was to complete the cleansing; the effect, to recreate the closed environment that prevailed at home. All of this proved great for purity but bad for business, knowledge, and know-how

In this simulacrum of Iberian society, the skills, curiosity, initiatives, and civic interests of North America were wanting. Spain itself lagged in these respects, owing to its spiritual homogeneity and docility, its wealth and pursuit of vanities; and Spain exported its weaknesses overseas. How could it be otherwise? Those Spanish who came to the New World did not go there to break the mold. They went to get rich by it and even bribed people to obtain places and offices; a few years would do the trick. The road to wealth passed, not by work, but by graft and (mis)rule. These contrasts in economic potential were matched by differences in political capability. The North American colonists came out of a society of dissent, moderately open to strangers and new ideas

In Latin America, independence came not of colonial ideology and political initiative but of the weaknesses and misfortunes of Spain (and Portugal) at home, in the context of European rivalries and wars. When Spain proved unable to rule from across the sea, New World strongmen exploited the vacuum and seized power, encountering only spotty resistance. Independence slipped in—a surprise to unformed, inchoate entities that had no aim but to change masters.5 This kind of anarchic negativism invited macho warlordism (caudillismo). N o wonder the history of Latin America in the nineteenth century was a pennydreadful of conspiracies, cabals, coups and countercoups—with all that these entailed in insecurity, bad government, corruption, and economic retardation.

these were not "modern" political units. They had no direction, no identity, no symbolism of nationality; so no measure of performance, no pressure of expectations. Civil society was absent. At the top, a small group of rascals, well taught by their earlier colonial masters, looted freely. Below, the masses squatted and scraped. The new "states" of Latin America were little different, then, from Asia's autocratic despotisms, though sometimes decked with republican trappings. In such instability and insecurity, no writ of authority went far. In the underpopulated open spaces, notables throned on their ranches and haciendas, ruling as well as employing, exercising private justice and police power. The nearest analogy would be the baronial domains of East Elbean Prussia, where the state stopped at the front gate. In the cities— usually ports where home goods crossed imports and customs duties yielded hard cash—the notables and their henchmen divided the spoils. The one coherent institution that might have made a difference, the Catholic Church, had a vested interest in the status quo. It owned much of the land, and its wealth hung there like an apple of envy and discord. When the state got ready to seize these assets, the Church found few friends

aside from alcohol, sex, and violence, the Church offered the only serious antidote to despair. The trouble was, it saw all intellectual and political novelty as subversive. A few liberals believed in fine slogans and sought to pull the people into the present. Much of their political energy was spent in a running war with the clergy. As a result, newly independent Latin America saw few economic changes. As before, the key sectors were mining (gold, silver, copper), agriculture, cattle raising, forestry. The aim: to produce a surplus that could be traded for foreign manufactures. Litde was done for industry, and litde industry was done. As any good British classical economist would have advised, these cobbled political entities stayed with comparative advantage. Besides, manufactures were potentially antisocial. They would compete for scarce labor and generate a discontented proletariat. The Latin American countries had no program, then, no vision of economic development

the nations of South America remained, after independence as before, economic dependencies of the advanced industrial nations: Britain to begin with; then Germany toward the end of the nineteenth century, reflecting its scientific and technological gains; and from the twentieth century, the United States. Foreigners built the railways and port facilities, in large part to tap the surpluses of the interior (just as in India).7 Foreigners lent money at high rates to poor regimes and their opponents (bad borrowers pay, and should pay, more). Foreigners built arsenals and plants and ran them. Naturally, foreigners were blamed for all the shortcomings of these economies. This cultivation of resentment, partially justified but dogmatically exaggerated, made everything worse. It ideologized economic policy, turned practical matters into issues of principle. (The irony—but not unconnected—was that in colonial times, the Spanish and their clergy had done their utmost to keep foreigners out. Here are the comments of a ship's officer visiting Manila in 1788: "Since the Spanish make a rule of prohibiting entry to foreigners, the inns, the furnished hotels, all those amenities so necessary to hospitality are absolutely unknown, and one has to be ready to sleep in the street when all one has is money and no personal connections in the place."

South America's industrial beginnings did not generate an industrial revolution. Even the construction of railways did not do the trick. Some things had to be done at home: the machines had to be serviced and repaired, for example. But these shops stuck to maintenance; almost never did they move on to manufacturing on their own. Once again, natural and social circumstances were unfavorable. Fuel and materials cost more than in Europe or the United States, and skills were wanting. It was all very rational: comparative advantage made it easier and cheaper to buy abroad

The trouble with such rationality is that today's good sense may be tomorrow's mistake. Development is long; logic, short. The economic theory is static, based on conditions of the day. The process is dynamic, building on today's abstinence to tomorrow's abundance.* Some things will never happen if one does not try to make them happen. If the Germans had listened to John Bowring . . . That British economic traveler extraordinary lamented that the foolish Germans wanted to make iron and steel instead of sticking to wheat and rye and buying their manufactures from Britain. Had they heeded him, they would have pleased the economists and replaced Portugal, with its wine, cork, and olive oil, as the very model of a rational economy. They would also have ended up a lot poorer

The Latin country with the best chances was Argentina, although no one would have suspected this in the great days of Spanish empire. Buenos Aires around 1600 was the end of the world. Located on open grasslands lightiy peopled, it was a way station between the silver of Potosi, high in the Andes in today's Bolivia, and the food exports of southeastern Brazil. Commerce was in the hands of Portuguese traders

In colonial times, Spanish policy aimed to truncate Argentine commerce. For reasons of control and taxation, the empire banned export of silver from Buenos Aires and tried to get all shipments out of Potosi to follow the Andean-Pacific route (over the mountains and down to the Pacific, up the west coast to the Isthmus of Panama, across to the Caribbean and on to Europe). With only partial success. Argentina's northern provinces supplied food, livestock, raw cotton, and homespun to what became for a while one of the largest cities in the Americas (160,000 people at the start of the seventeenth century), altitude 15,843 gasping feet; while the silver earned thereby paid in the Atlantic ports for iron, weapons, clothing, and other European manufactures. Needless to say, the inflated value of this contraband invited all manner of corruption

The break with Spain (1816) and fragmentation of the old Spanish empire brought an end to this trade. But the natural gifts of the Argentine remained: a wide range of climates, including a temperate core; treeless, open grasslands (the pampas), excellent for raising catde and sheep; good soil for cereals; some places suited to semitropical crops such as cotton and sugar. The country had few industrial resources, however—no iron, coal, timber, petroleum, or minerals to speak of. Such waterpower as there was, along the eastern side of the cordillera, lay far from trade routes and traders. Of manufacturing, litde, and most of that the remnants of domestic industry

Argentina, always a land of cattle and sheep, knew less of crops and men. The triumph of pastoralism and the relative neglect of agriculture were closely linked to land and immigration policies. Foreign observers saw the country as a potential magnet for settlers. So did some farsighted natives, who called for a wider recruitment of immigrants, in particular, of settlers from Protestant Europe, whom they saw as better educated, harder working, politically mature. This would require, of course, a change in either the policy or the power of the Catholic Church; also of attitudes deep-rooted in the population

Compare land policy in the North American colonies and the United States. In the southern colonies, large holdings needed slave labor. The native Indians were few and unwilling, and free whites would not work for wages when land there was aplenty and one could be one's own master. So blacks were brought in from Africa until such imports were banned as of 1807. After that, the use of slaves could be maintained only by natural reproduction, which entailed a higher standard of nourishment and treatment than prevailed in the Caribbean or South America. Meanwhile Americans increasingly found slavery repugnant, and the expansion of the republic westward touched off fights over the extension of servitude and the nature of the compact that had made the Union. In the end, as everyone knows, civil war settled the matter. The slaves went free, and the large estates dissolved into family-sized units

to encourage railway construction. New lines were granted land along the right-of-way, and these in turn sought generally to sell them to independent farmers. These were preferred, not because they were more lovable, but because they generated more freight than ranchers. In the last analysis, nature had its say: as one went west and rainfall diminished, more of the land went in large tracts for livestock and herding. Meanwhile towns became cities, and cities flourished, not only as markets and shipping points, but also as centers of manufacture. A good example: Cincinnati, largest city of the pre-Civil War West, center of meat processing and rendering ("Porkopolis"), pole of attraction for German immigrants, city of small factories making, among other things, jewelry, stoves, and musical instruments.

Many of these migrants were seasonal agricultural workers, the so-calledgolondrinas (swallows), recruited largely in southern Italy, travel paid from Buenos Aires to place of work and back. Almost half of the 290 thousand immigrants per year in the decade 1904-13 turned around and left—an average of 135.7 thousand. This was an economical arrangement from the Argentine point of view: bring in harvesters and then send them away. It also suited the migrants, who could exploit the inverse harvest season north and south of the equa

character of the immigration also was significantly different. Most newcomers to the United States came from the British Isles and northwestern Europe, with southern and eastern Europe picking up toward the end of the nineteenth century. More of them were literate; many were trained craftsmen (classified as "skilled"); until the 1840s, more of them were farmers than laborers.2 2 The immigrants were drawn by the prospect of cheap homesteads and high wages, and few of them went to the slave South. By comparison with Latin America, these newcomers brought with them greater knowledge and skills.

For most of these newcomers, the United States was a land of hope and unlimited possibilities. Personal considerations played their part. Immigrants came because their predecessors wrote happy, if not always true, letters about life in the New World. They came because relatives, friends, and neighbors preceded them; and when they arrived, they went to stay with or lodge near their forerunners. They came to a country that in the nineteenth century offered just about no obstacle to admission. Many went back—perhaps a third. But the great majority stayed (or came back a second time), found jobs alongside their kin, moved about with a freedom they had never known in the Old World.

Argentina. Its economic takeoff had to wait for the second half or even the last third of the nineteenth century. When it came, it closely fit the Ricardian trade model. The major growth sector was livestock, which yielded hides for leather and wool (often together and exported to such wool-pulling centers as Mazamet in France), tallow, and salt beef. When refrigeration came in the 1880s, it gave a big boost to the meat trade, especially to Britain. At first the process worked best with lamb and mutton, but as techniques improved and temperatures became more reliable and precise, Argentina began sending frozen beef and then much tastier chilled meat. Agricultural development lagged, primarily because labor was scarce; but the opposition of ranchers and the depredations of the tenacious Araucanian Indians, still fighting the Europeans after three hundred years, created further impediments. (As in the American West, or for that matter in Africa, it took repeating weapons to crush native resistance.) The hostility of the Indians is understandable: they were fighting for their land. But the ranchers also: farming means fences and an end to open range. (One can't have catde tromping the furrows and eating the crops.) Still, as in the American West, the barbed wire moved forward in Argentina, the cheapest cattle-unfriendly fencing ever devised.*

The Indians, as in the United States, would not work for wages, and Indian corvee labor was abolished, at least in principle, in 1813. The slave trade was also banned, and while slaves already there remained in servitude, their children were born free; further, any slaves imported from abroad became free on entry.

The answer had to be immigration, but here, too, yesterday weighed on today. Spanish rules of exclusion had discouraged entry; and even after independence, immigration was dampened by political instability, selective recruitment, and the lack of free land. This last was one of the worst legacies of the colonial regime: vast domains had been given away, assigned to the Church and to men of respect and power, and the leftovers were grabbed up during the troubles that followed the revolution. Further territorial gains, we saw, were followed by similar distributions. Thus the 1879 campaign against the Indians (what the Argentines grandly described as la conquista del desierto, the conquest of the wilderness) was preceded and financed by land sales, some 8.5 million hectares going to 381 persons. The buyers needed all the land they could get, for as one moved southward, the climate became arid, the soil barren. Patagonia could support perhaps a tenth as many sheep per area as the province of Buenos Aires

For many decades, these migrants fitted uncomfortably into this proudly backward society, full of illusions and prejudices, singularly unwelcoming. Most of them stayed in Buenos Aires, with its semicosmopolitan culture.

Once Argentina got into high gear, in part owing to the new, imported technologies (steam navigation, railway transport, agricultural machinery, meat refrigeration), in part to growing European demand (population growth, increased purchasing power), product and income increased substantially, to levels comparable to those of industrializing European nations.

agriculture alone was not going to generate the productivity, income, and wage gains attainable in a balanced economy.2 5 Farm workers, particularly hired (migrant) laborers, typically earn a fraction of industrial wages. Meanwhile the estancieros, rancheros, professionals, officials, and the boutique trade that catered to them made money. As elsewhere, clocks and watches were both sign and instrument of a modern, timeconscious society. Swiss and American makers vied for this new market and fashioned imposing timepieces to the Latin taste.2 6 At the end of the nineteenth century, Argentina was a most promising example of staples success, and optimists predicted a future like (or almost like) that of the United States. Even today, neoclassical economists gush over this case study in the benefits of comparative advantage. But was it optimal? This country had some very rich people, yet "for reasons that have never been clear . . . has always been capitaldependent and thereby beholding [sic] to loaner [lender] nations, in ways that seriously compromise the country's ability to run its own

The British built Argentina's railroads—less than 1,000 kilometers in 1871, over 12,000 kilometers two decades later—but built them to British purposes: to move meat and wheat to the ports. Not to develop internal markets in Argentina, say the locals. But how does one build such a network without fostering internal markets? And if not, whose fault? What does that say about the spirit of native enterprise? The Argentines were not asking such questions. It is always easier to blame the Other. The result: a xenophobic anti-imperialism and self-defeating sense of wrong

Withal, nature's bounty made up the difference. Economic growth continued into the twentieth century, not only in agriculture but also in the young industrial sector. This took the form of direct investment by multinationals, particularly in food processing;* and of import substitution, effected largely by small enterprises (most of them owned by foreigners and many of these, in the 1930s, by Jewish refugees) and promoted by periods of short supply (as during World War I), a few protective tariffs, bilateral agreements, and exchange controls.2 8 One should not exaggerate this late and stunted industrial sector. The data in the census of 1914—after twenty-five years, then, of mixed agriculture and heavy immigration—show that over half the "industrial" capital was in mining; a quarter in public services; and only 13.6 percent could be characterized as "basically manufacturing."2 9 This production, necessarily derivative, showed litde invention or adaptation. N o increasing returns. It throve (survived) in primitive working conditions that recall the nightmare mills of the early British Industrial Revolution, but worse because the state didn't care. Nor did the employers, who assumed that casualties could be easily replaced by immigrant labor. They knew litde of the technology of their own business and could not be expected to think of improving human capital. A few enlightened people tried to persuade these primitives that better workers and working conditions would be to their own advantage. They were dismissed as impractical Utopians who knew nothing about factories and industry. The result was industry in a time warp of backwardness

Each industry had its particular health hazards. In the textile, metal, match and glass factories, the air was always full of a fine dust that irritated the lungs. In leather factories, the curing process required the use of sulfuric, nitric, and muriatic acids as well as arsenic and ammonia, all of which gave off harmful vapors that filled the building. In the packinghouses, workers trod upon floors that were slippery with coagulated blood, entrails, and animal excrement. The stench was overwhelming. The men who carried meat to the freezers had to wrap their hands and faces in rags or old newspapers, being careful not to have any fresh blood on their clothes lest it freeze to their bodies. Rheumatism was a common ailment, and few packinghouse workers lasted more than five years

Argentine industry, then, was not a driver but a passenger of growth. When a time of troubles returned after World War II, it left the vehicle. Labor, whether in industry or agriculture, was not happy and took to those ideological nostrums—anarchism before World War I, Perônism after World War II—that are the revenge of the powerless. The economist Paul Samuelson attributed this alienation to the discrepancy between economic backwardness and social indifference on the one hand, political precocity on the other.3 1 The people wanted what neither economy nor state could give

The failure of Latin American development, all the worse by contrast with North America, has been attributed by local scholars and outside sympathizers to the misdeeds of stronger, richer nations. This vulnerability has been labeled "dependency," implying a state of inferiority where one does not control one's fate; one does as others dictate. Needless to say, these others exploit their superiority to transfer product from the dependent economies, much as the earlier colonial rulers did. The pump of empire becomes the pump of capitalist imperialism

So with Argentina, which saved litde and drew increasingly on foreign capital.* Some economists contend that foreign capital hurts growth; others, that it helps, but less than domestic investment. Much obviously depends on the uses. In the meantime, no one is prepared to refuse outside money on grounds of efficiency. The politicians want it and are willing to let the dependency theorists wring their hands.

foreign capital flows depended as much on supply conditions abroad as on Argentine opportunities. During World War I, the British needed money and had to liquidate foreign assets. Although remaining Argentina's biggest creditor, they no longer played the growth-promoting role of earlier decades. The United States and others picked up some of the slack, but here, too, politics and the business cycle abroad called the tune, so that Argentina found itself in intermittent but repeated difficulty both for the amount and terms of foreign investment and credit. All of this promoted conflict with creditors, which led in turn to reactive isolationism—restrictive measures that only aggravated the stringency and dependency. When Argentine economists and politicians denounced these circumstances and the misdeeds, real and imagined, of outside interests, they only compounded the problem. To be sure, cocoon economics helped shelter Argentina and other Latin American economies from the worst effects of the Great Depression. Such is the nature of cocoons. But it also cut them off from competition, stimuli, and opportunities for growth.

Gilberto Freyre, in his classic study of Brazilian civilization, The Masters and the Slaves, distinguishes between Spanish and Portuguese policies of colonial settlement. Where the Spanish introduced national as well as religious restrictions, the Portuguese cared only for religion. The immigrant could come from anywhere, so long as he was Roman Catholic. In certain periods, a friar was sent abroad every vessel entering a Brazilian port to examine and verify the conscience and faith of the new arrivals. Nothing else mattered, because this was the seal of common identity. "Whereas the Anglo-Saxon regards an individual as being of his race only when the latter is of the same physical type as himself, the Portuguese forgets race and regards as his equal the one who professes the same religion." (Such are the myths of national pride, as the very title of Freyre's book testifies

The trouble with idealized, reformist states is that they gain strength by improvement and then succumb to temptation. They threaten and subvert their neighbors, upset the balance of power and the status quo. Such actions invite reactions. So it was that the dictators of little Paraguay nursed ambitions, along with fears of danger from the bigger countries around; in short, a rational, latently irrational paranoia. (Who says paranoiacs don't have enemies?) The biggest threat came from Argentina, which saw Paraguay as a rebellious province and sought to annex it.3 8 But all the neighboring countries looked unkindly on revolutionary experiments next door. Paraguay's leaders, then, were determined to build the economy and acquire the armaments necessary to defend and attack in all directions. For this, they needed not only weapons but the tools and machines of industry. These could be had solely from Europe, and although Paraguay, with its Indian legacy, had an aversion to things European, Europeans overseas were more likely to be helpful than covetous neighbors

Those sixteenth-century Europeans who sailed into the Indian Ocean and made their way to China met an unaccustomed shock of alien condescension. The Celestial Empire—the name tells everything—saw itself as the world's premier political entity: first in size and population, first in age and experience, untouchable in its cultural achievement and sense of moral, spiritual, and intellectual superiority. The Chinese lived, they thought, at the center of the universe. Around them, lesser breeds drew on their glow, reached out to them for light, gained stature by doing obeisance and offering tribute. The Chinese emperor was the "Son of Heaven," unique, godlike representative of celestial power. Those few who entered his presence showed their awe by kowtowing—kneeling and touching their head nine times to the ground. Others kowtowed to anything emanating from him— a letter, a single handwritten ideograph. The paper he wrote on, the clothes he wore, everything he touched partook of his divine essence

Such cultural triumphalism combined with petty downward tyranny made China a reluctant improver and a bad learner. Improvement would have challenged comfortable orthodoxies and entailed insubordination; the same for imported knowledge and ideas.3 In effect, what was there to learn? This rejection of the foreign was the more anxious for the very arrogance that justified it. That is the paradox of the superiority complex: it is intrinsically insecure and brittie. Those who cherish it need it and fear nothing so much as contradiction. (The French today so trumpet the superiority of their language that they tremble at the prospect of a borrowed word, especially if it comes from English.)* So Ming China—convinced of its ascendancy—quaked before the challenge of Western technology, which was there for the learning

those first Portuguese visitors and Catholic missionaries used the wonders of Western technology to charm their way into China. The mechanical clock was the key that unlocked the gates. This, we saw, was a European mega-invention of the late thirteenth century, crucial for its contribution to discipline and productivity, but also for its susceptibility of improvement and its role at the frontier of instrumentation and mechanical technique

The Catholic priests who brought them these machines were salesmen of a special kind. They sought to convert the Chinese to the one true trinitarian God of the Roman Church, and the clocks served a twofold purpose: entry ticket and argument for Christian superiority. Those who could make these things, who possessed special astronomical and geographical knowledge into the bargain, were they not superior in the largest moral sense? Was not their faith truer, wiser

Premodern imperial China did not think of time knowledge as a right. Time belonged to the authorities, who sounded (proclaimed) the hour, and a personal timepiece was a rare privilege. As a result, although the imperial court set up workshops to make clocks and got their Jesuit clockmakers to train some native talent, these Chinese makers never matched Western horologists—for want of the best teachers and lack of commercial competition and emulation. Imperial China never had a clockmaking trade like Europe's. The same sin of pride (or indifference) shaped China's response to European armament. Here we have anything but a toy. Cannon and muskets were instruments of death, hence of power. The Chinese had every reason to desire these artifacts, for the seventeenth century saw the Ming dynasty fighting to survive and losing to Tartars from the north. In these decades of war, European inventions might have tilted the balance of power. And yet the Chinese never learned to make modern guns. Worse yet, having known and used cannon as early as the thirteenth century, they had let knowledge and skill slip away. Their city walls and gates had emplacements for cannon, but no cannon. Who needed them? N o enemy of China had them.* But China did have enemies, without and within. N o European nation would have been deterred from armament by enemy weakness; when it came to death, Europeans maximized. European technology was also incremental: each gain led to further gain. The Chinese record of step-forward, step-back, signaled an entirely different process

Europeans saw the purpose of war as to kill the enemy and win; the Chinese, strong in space and numbers, thought otherwise. Here is Mu Fu-sheng (a pseudonym) on the imperial viewpoint: . . . military defeat was the technical reason why Western knowledge should be acquired, but it was also the psychological reason why it should not be. Instinctively the Chinese preferred admitting military defeat, which could be reversed, to entering a psychological crisis; people could stand humiliation but not self-debasement. . . . The mandarins sensed the threat to Chinese civilization irrespective of the economic and political issues and they tried to resist this threat without regard to the economic and political dangers. In the past the Chinese had never had to give up their cultural pride: the foreign rulers always adopted the Chinese civilization. Hence there was nothing in their history to guide them through their modern crisis

The rejection of foreign technology was the more serious because China itself had long slipped into technological and scientific torpor, coasting along on previous gains and losing speed as talent yielded to gentility. After all, China was its own world. Why did it not produce its own scientific and industrial revolutions? A thousand years ago, the Chinese were well ahead of anyone else—and certainly of Europe.

China lacked institutions for finding and learning— schools, academies, learned societies, challenges and competitions. The sense of give-and-take, of standing on the shoulders of giants, of progress—all of these were weak or absent. Here was another paradox. On the one hand, the Chinese formally worshipped their intellectual ancestors; in 1734, an imperial decree required court physicians to make ritual sacrifices to their departed predecessors.1 7 On the other, they let the findings of each new generation slip into oblivion, to be recovered later, perhaps, by antiquarian and archeological research

This want of exchange and challenge, this subjectivity, explains the uncertainty of gains and the easy loss of impetus. Chinese savants had no way of knowing when they were right. It is subsequent research, mostly Western, that has discovered and awarded palms of achievement to the more inspired. Small wonder that China reacted so unfavorably to European imports. European knowledge was not only strange and implicitly belittling. In its ebullience and excitement, its urgency and competitiveness, its brutal commitment to truth and efficacy (Jesuits excepted), it went against the Chinese genius. So the years passed, and the decades, and the centuries. Europe left China far behind. At first unbelieving and contemptuous, China grew anxious and frustrated. From asking and begging, the Westerners became insistent and impatient. The British saw two embassies dismissed with contempt. The third time, in 1839, they came in gunboats and blew the door down. Other Western nations followed suit, and then the Japanese, with their own pretensions to dominion after the Meiji Restoration (1868), moved to secure their place alongside Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia

the outsiders barely scratched the surface of the porcelain kingdom: some trading cities along the coast; uncertain spheres of influence in the interior; the right to import opium, kerosene, and manufactures. These represented only a small fraction of the market, but the potential size of the market—so many people!—made China the legendary El Dorado of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Inside the brittle skin, the empire was restless, the people unhappy, the mandarinate divided, the rulers insecure. The Qing (pronounced "Ching") dynasty (1644-1912), remember, was of Manchu origin. A small nomadic people of perhaps 1 million seized a nation of hundreds of millions and held them captive for two hundred fifty years

The first years of the new dynasty saw improvement. Peace and order were restored; food supply kept up with demand. This was Europe's greatest gift to the people that thought it had everything: new crops (potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts) that could be grown on otherwise barren, upland soils. But now Chinese population grew sharply—the traditional Malthusian response—and when food supply leveled off, famine, hunger, and civil unrest returned

anger blocked economic modernization. Foreign ownership and management, for example, immensely complicated the introduction of railways. Steamboats were equated with gunboats—instruments of penetration and oppression. Mechanization, discouraged by an abundance of cheap labor and the reluctance of women to work outside the home, was tarred with the same brush.1 8 As a result, factory industry barely had a foothold at the end of the nineteenth century, creeping into the foreign settiements of the treaty ports, extraterritorial carbuncles on the hide of the Chinese empire. Since the country could not defend itself against imports by tariffs—forbidden by the unequal treaties imposed from outside—these "plantation" enterprises had little exemplary influence on the domestic economy. China remained overwhelmingly agricultural with a scattered overlay of handicraft industry. And poor

Like other myths, it aims to shape the truth to higher ends, to form opinion in some other cause. In this instance, the myth is true in pointing out that modern science, in the course of its development, took up knowledge discovered by other civilizations; and that it absorbed and combined such knowledge and know-how with European findings. The myth is wrong, however, in implying a continuing symmetrical interaction among diverse civilizations. In the beginning, when China and others were ahead, almost all the transmission went one way, from the outside to Europe. That was Europe's great virtue: unlike China, Europe was a learner, and indeed owed much to earlier Chinese inventions and discoveries. Later on, of course, the story was different: once Europe had invented modern science, the current flowed back, though not without resistance. Here, too, the myth misleads by implying a kind of equal, undifferentiated contribution to the common treasure. The vast bulk of modern science was of Europe's making, especially that breakthrough of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that goes by the name "scientific revolution." Not only did non-Western science contribute just about nothing (though there was more there than Europeans knew), but at that point it was incapable of participating, so far had it fallen behind or taken the wrong turning. This was no common stream

The Europeans were used to strange peoples; the Japanese, not: The Japanese were first surprised to see the red-bearded, blue-eyed men, and then astonished by the natural power of their guns and powder. They were made to realize how great was the world . . . by the strange birds, curious beasts, precious silk, and beautiful damask brought from islands in the tropical zone and China. They wondered at the ideas and learning . . . the Japanese people, putting all this together, believed that there was a new heaven and earth far over the sea, and were thirsty to know this civilization. For this civilization was not like the quiet study of Confucianism, but a practical achievement before their eyes. Those who came from this new heaven and earth raised the price of merchandise, which had been almost a drug, to the great surprise of the Japanese, and demanded an unlimited supply, so that even a blade of grass or a tree had some value in the market. . . . The Japanese could not understand why this foreign trade was profitable to them. That they should become intimate with the Portuguese thus rich and thus strong, and learn their civilization, was the general idea of that time. . . .4 In these circumstances, European visitors got a much warmer greeting than they had received in China. The Chinese had wanted to quarantine them, like an infection. The Japanese, as soon as they realized the mighty powers of these strangers—their ability, for example, to shoot down birds in flight—took them in with open arms and vied with one another to learn their secrets. They also sought to trade with them, because the gains were substantial. And the Europeans, on their side, seeing an opportunity to plant themselves in this welcoming society and get rich, scurried to make themselves useful

The Japanese were learners because they had unlimited aspirations. Their mythology told of a ruler descended from the sun goddess and a land at the center of creation. They thought of themselves as a people specially chosen, as warrior-dominators with all of East Asia as legitimate domain.* They had long been culturally subordinate to China, takers rather than givers, students rather than teachers. Their ideographic writing and writing implements came from China; much of their language as well.1" Their knowledge of silk, ceramics, and printing, their furnishings and the style of their paintings, their Buddhist beliefs, their knowledge of Confucianism—all from China.

when the Japanese encountered the Europeans, they went about learning their ways. They copied their arms; they imitated their timekeepers; they converted in large numbers to Christianity. And still felt superior. The vogue for Christianity seemed destined to sweep all. The new faith had much success among local rulers, and even more among the marginal members of a hard, edge-of-subsistence population. These were classical conversion strategies: get the leaders to come along and let them compel their subjects; or give love and nourishment to those in need of moral and material support

in this snakepit of conflict and intrigue, the one test that the Christians could not pass was that of earthly loyalty. For the rulers of Japan, no obligation stood higher than the personal allegiance a man owed his lord; no command more absolute than that of lord to man— even to the point of taking his own life. Even a hint that suicide was advisable amounted to a death sentence. How else prove one's loyalty than to take the hint?

for Japanese Christians, the highest loyalty and duty was to God. They had stopped thinking like good Japanese. So, when suspicious chieftains put their Christians to the test, the Christians failed. The Buddhists, Confucianists, and xénophobes were right. Here was a threat to Japanese values and political stability. In 1612, then, after backing and filling, Tokugawa Ieyasu banned the Christian religion. How many Japanese were Christian at that point is hard to say. Perhaps 300,000. Some estimates run as high as 700,000, in a population of 18 million. The Japanese went about eradicating Christianity with characteristic ferocity. Nero would have been ashamed for his softness. Christians were compelled publicly to abjure. Those who refused or backslid were tortured and burned or beheaded

Root-and-branch religious persecution stood apart at first from trade relations, which proved extremely profitable, but in the long run the two came together, leading to Japan's commercial and cultural isolation. No other way to keep Christian missionaries and propaganda out. In 1616, all foreign merchant vessels—except Chinese—were barred from ports other than Nagasaki and Hirado. Foreign residence was limited to Edo (later named Tokyo), Kyoto, and Sakai. In 1624, the Spanish were barred; in 1639, the Portuguese. The English just stopped coming. That left the Dutch

From 1633, Japanese vessels needed official authorization to leave the country; three years later, all Japanese ships were confined to home waters. From 1637, no Japanese was allowed to leave the country by whatever means—no exit. What's more, no return, on penalty of death. Those Japanese who had moved abroad for trade, some tens of thousands to the Philippines and Southeast Asia, were now shipwrecked in exile. Then, in 1639, after suppression of the Christians at Shimabara (what the Japanese call the Shimabara rebellion), no foreigners were permitted to come and trade, except for Koreans at a small island off Honshu (the main island), and Dutch and Chinese on the artificial island of Deshima in Nagasaki Bay. Except when summoned, the Dutch were held under house arrest. They had two streets of warehouses and offices to promenade in. Their food, drink, servants, and sex came in to them from the mainland. They drank, smoked, played cards, and languished in boredom and stupefaction. Not a good assignment. The Japanese wanted it that way. All of this was part of a larger process of self-petrification. Japan had had enough of discovery and innovation, enough fire and blood. The aim now: freeze the social order, fix relations of social and political hierarchy, prevent disagreement and conflict. Lines were drawn between statuses, and status was fixed from birth

Unions across status lines were forbidden, and even among samurai, high were not to marry low.

Of the European artifacts that had so startled and impressed the Japanese, the most potent and tempting was the gun; but this too was banned. The gun had helped settle the battles of the civil wars. So well had the Japanese taken to it that they learned to make their own and improved on European models. Indeed, at one point in the late sixteenth century the Japanese may well have been manufacturing more muskets than any single European nation.8 Once these wars were settled, however, and the nation united under a single government, guns no longer served a useful purpose.

The Japanese kept unequal hours—unequal as between day and night, unequal across seasons. They divided daytime and nighttime separately into equal parts, so daytime hours equaled night hours only at the equinoxes; and of course day hours were longer in summer, shorter in winter, and vice versa for night hours

Japan's decision to isolate itself from the outside world, to return to tradition and live in a bubble, appears no different from China's refusal of the West. If anything, it was more adamant in its principled rigor. But how different the outcome! It was the Chinese who, though changing in detail and passing from one political challenge to another, remained the same in substance; and the Japanese who, clinging to old ways, so changed that they had every prospect of industrializing, even without the Western challenge, on the eve of the Meiji Restoration. One may distinguish two aspects of the paradox: ( 1 ) the forces making for change within Japan; and (2) the effect of contacts with the outside world

In medieval Europe, feudal lords owned land and took most of their revenue in kind or in labor (which produced income in the form of crops). Over time, however, with the rise of a new world of cities and towns and exposure to strange things and people, the seigneurs and their ladies conceived new needs and wants. To satisfy these, landlords converted more and more of their traditional income into money, which could be spent as one pleased; hence a long-run tendency in western Europe to commute manorial dues into money rents (the key to peasant emancipation

In Japan, the same. The fiscal system ran on rice, in other words, on the principal food staple, and this arrangement (kokudaka-sei) was designed to take care of the ruling elite. The lord (daimyd) took roughly 30 percent of the harvest, kept much of it for himself and his household, and distributed the rest to his stipendiary samurai retainers

The system fed people according to rank. In principle, nothing more was needed. But since there is more to life than eating and the appetite for noncomestibles grows with status, the lord and his retainers needed to convert much of their rice income into money, the better to enjoy life's finer things. For this they turned to the despised merchants, who played an ever more active role in what was supposed to be a quiet economy but instead bubbled with desire

Again the parallel with Europe is striking. Japan did not have Calvinism, but its businessmen adopted a similar work ethic. The key lay in the commitment to work rather than to wealth. The Zen monk Suzuki Shosan (1579-1655) saw greed as a spiritual poison; but work was something else: "All occupations are Buddhist practice; through work we are able to attain Buddhahood [salvation]."1 5 One does not have to be a Weberian Protestant to behave like one. (Japanese scholars have noted that this work ethic was not universal in time or space, but that the latter half of the Edo period was marked by intensified labor and the propagation of work habits that stood the economy in good stead once it moved on to modern industry. In their words, an "industrious revolution" prepared the way for the industrial revolution.

Edo, a fishing village at the end of the sixteenth century, was the largest city in the world in the eighteenth, with over 1 million people out of perhaps 26 million for the nation as a whole. Like London in England, Edo became the heart and lungs of the country, pumping and renewing the economic life blood, drawing people in and out, promoting division of labor and the diffusion of wants, knowledge, and know-how.2 3 Edo was the great marketplace, where samurai competed in conspicuous consumption and enriched a swarm of craftsmen and tradesmen. This was a shopkeeper's heaven that boasted the world's first department stores

the older business center: alongside Edo and much larger at first stood the OsakaKyoto duo, seat of the emperor and his court, hub of industry, banking, and trade.2 4 These two primary centers and their network of provincial connections fueled new techniques of buying (including futures trading), of distribution (much of it by coastal shipping in specialized vessels), and of remittance (bills of exchange, transferable warehouse receipts, clearing), much as in Europe's commercial revolution of the Middle Ages and early modern period, only more s o . 2 5 And faster.

The so-called Toyama drug sellers, for example, would leave a stock of their goods with farmers and return later on to be paid for whatever had been used. That says something about Japanese neatness (no small matter) and honesty (even more important).2 7 More densely settled areas warranted the establishment of fixed outlets.

the enterprising ban called Satsuma, southwesternmost province, far from Edo and Bakufu control. In 1825, Satsuma's government was bankrupt. Salaries of retainers were over a year in arrears; grass and weeds grew rank in the ban*s compounds in Edo; the big bankers in Osaka refused to lend another cent. In 1831, the ban leaders summarily repudiated all debt to local businessmen and effectively nullified obligations to merchants in Osaka and Edo by rescheduling payments over a period of two hundred fifty years.3 4 Yet twenty years later, the ban treasury was overflowing, and merchants were lining up to offer credit. What happened in between? Sugar. Satsuma, blessed by a warm, maritime climate, was made for cane. Once the ban realized the value of sugar, it mandated increased planting and forbade all other crops on its offshore islands. Cultivation was stringently controlled, and those peasants who failed the quality test were severely punished. It was the ban that set the price and then sold the sugar in Osaka at two to five times that amount

N o more need to borrow. Satsuma was soon producing one half the national sugar crop.3 5 Meanwhile Satsuma had a privileged position in international trade. In theory, only Chinese and Dutch vessels could come to Japan, and then only to Nagasaki. But Satsuma was the effective ruler of the nominally Chinese Ryukyu Islands, and this made possible a lucrative smuggling operation bypassing the shogunate's controls. Again, no need for credit: the merchants were glad to pay cash for cheaper imports. Unfortunately, these same imports hurt home industry, including manufacture of cotton goods in Satsuma itself. " O f all things Western, what do you dread most?" asked the Satsuma daimyd Shimazu Nariakira of his councilors. European guns and ships, came the answer. " N o , " said the daimyd. "It is cotton cloth. Unless we begin preparing now, we shall soon be dependent on Westerners for our clothing."3 6 In an effort to prepare, the han began to distribute better cotton seeds, purchased better spindles and looms (not yet powered), built a manufactory near Kagoshima, and set unemployed samurai to work there. The result: cotton goods costing half as much as before

Satsuma began to invest in war and modernity. This was a han with a disproportionate number of samurai, one in three people as against a national average of one in seventeen. Idle warriors were the makings of power; also of management; also of trouble. Nariakira chose to focus on the first two. H e built up the army, bought foreign arms and vessels, and undertook a program of economic development: a research center (the Shuseikan), an iron foundry using a reverberatory furnace (the first in Japan), an arsenal, a shipyard. In 1855, Satsuma was able to put a steam vessel into the water. In 1867, it opened a mechanized cotton mill

It was technicians from Satsuma, often drawn from the lowest levels of samurai (thus talent before birth), who staffed key positions in the national government of the Meiji Restoration. But it was also Satsuma that became a stronghold of reaction after 1870 and led a revolt of the old order.

Japan had a revolution in 1 8 6 7 - 6 8. The shogunate was over­ thrown—really it collapsed—and control of the state returned to the emperor in Kyoto. So ended a quarter millennium of Tokugawa rule. But the Japanese do not call this overturn a revolution; a restoration rather, because they prefer to see it as a return to normalcy. Also, revolutions are for China. The Chinese have dynasties. Japan has one royal family, going back to the beginning. It was in the 1180s that Japan was first ruled, not by the emperor but by a warrior chief called a shogun (literally, leader of the army). With some interruptions and interregnums, this rule by the strongest became the normal pattern. Such is the weakness of heredity kingship: even with the help of divine ancestry, a dynasty is hard-put to maintain competence indefinitely. Weak genes, bad marriages, whatever: strong men, mayors of the palace, will rise to power and sooner or later oust the legitimate monarch. So it was in medieval France, where the Carolingians displaced the Merovingians and were pushed aside in turn by the usurper Capetians. In Japan, however, the solution was not to dethrone and expunge the dynasty, but to immure it. The emperor, his family, and his court were confined to their palaces and temples

the transition in Japan was far smoother than the French and Russian varieties of political overturn, for two reasons: the new regime held the high moral ground; and even the disaffected and affronted feared to give arms and opportunity to the enemy outside. Foreign imperialists were lurking to pounce, and internal divisions would invite intervention. Consider the story of imperialism elsewhere: local quarrels and intrigue had fairly invited the European powers into India

. Now the true revolutionaries took over: the rangakusha, the technicians, the forward-looking bureaucrats. The year 1868 began with the opening of more major ports to foreign trade. On April 6 the new emperor swore a "Charter Oath" promising representative institutions and the creation of a new democratic civil society. (It proved easier to promise than to do, and this gesture may have been directed more to outside observers than to the Japanese people.) What mattered more was the transformation of the central government: the abolition of feudal institutions, the conversion of the fiefs (ban) into prefectures (ken) administered by government appointees, the appropriation by the center of revenues that had gone to the old warrior elite

the Japanese knew they were superior, and because they knew it, they were able to recognize the superiorities of others. Building on earlier moves under Tokugawa, they hired foreign experts and technicians while sending Japanese agents abroad to bring back eyewitness accounts of European and American ways. This body of intelligence laid the basis for choices, reflecting careful and supple consideration of comparative merit. Thus the first military model was the French army; but after the defeat of France by Prussia in 1 8 7 0 - 7 1 , the Japanese decided that Germany had more to offer.

This direct experience by the Japanese leadership made all the difference. Riding on an English train and meditating on the industrial landscape, Okubo confided ruefully that, before leaving Japan, he had thought his work done: the imperial authority restored, feudalism replaced by central government. Now he understood that the big tasks lay ahead. Japan did not compare with "the more progressive powers of the world." England especially offered a lesson in self-development. Once a small insular nation—like Japan—England had systematically pursued a policy of self-aggrandizement. The navigation acts were crucial in raising the national merchant marine to a position of international dominance. Not until Britain had achieved industrial leadership did it abandon protection for laissez-faire. (Not a bad analysis. Adam Smith would not have disagreed.

recently come through a difficult unification. Also Germany, like Japan, had started from a position of economic inferiority, and look how far it had come. Okubo was much impressed by the German people he met. He found them thrifty, hardworking, "unpretentious"— like Japanese commoners, one imagines. And he found their leaders to be realists and pragmatists: focus, they said, on building national power. They were the mercantilists of the nineteenth century. Okubo came back and gave a German orientation to the Japanese bureaucracy.2 First came those tasks ordinary to government: a postal service, a new time standard,* public education (for boys and then for girls as well),* universal military service.** The last two in particular defined the new society. General schooling diffused knowledge; that is what schools are for. But it also instilled discipline, obedience, punctuality, and a worshipful respect for (adoration of) the emperor.3 This was the key to the development of a we/they national identity transcending parochial loyalties and status lines. The nation's calendar was homogenized around the Tenno cult. Every school had its picture of the emperor, and on every national holiday, the same ritual was performed in front of this icon throughout the country at the same time. The army (and navy) completed the job. Beneath the sameness of the uniform and the discipline, universal military service wiped out distinctions of class and place. It nurtured nationalist pride and democratized the violent virtues of manhood. In Japan, this meant generalization of the right to fight—an end to the samurai monopoly of arms. (Not every former commoner applauded the change. War and violence had always been the business of the elite, who were duly rewarded with stipends. Many of those too old to have been formed by the new common schools asked why they were now expected

In September 1871, the new Japan negotiated a treaty with China. The treaty did not accord Japan extraterritorial and commercial privileges like those already granted to the Western powers; but it was signed as between equals. A momentous "first"; inequality would come after. This was followed in 1874 by an expedition to Formosa (Taiwan), which in effect affirmed Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands and laid the basis for a later claim to Formosa itself. Then, in 1876, a naval expedition to Korea extracted Chinese recognition of Korean independence. This poisoned gift removed Korea's cover against eventual Japanese aggression, while securing for Japan extraterritorial and commercial privileges that would whet the Japanese appetite and lead to further gains. New Nippon, bursting with energy and force, knew a victim when it saw one. Great China lay wounded, and the very largeness of its earlier pretensions invited attack

state and society went about the business of business: how to make things by machine; how to do more without machines; how to move goods; how to compete with foreign producers. Not easy. European industrial nations had taken a century. Japan was in a hurry. To begin with, the country built on those branches of industry already familiar and changing even before Meiji—silk and cotton manufacture in particular, but also the processing of food staples immune from foreign imitation: sake, miso, soy sauce. From 1877 to 1900— the first generation of industrialization—food accounted for 40 percent of growth, textiles 35 percent.5 In short, the Japanese pursued comparative advantage rather than the will-o'-the-wisp of heavy industry. Much of this was small scale

early decades of groping experiment saw many failures. In the early 1880s, the government sold off its factories to private enterprises. This decision did it much credit: bureaucrats rarely admit mistakes or give up power. The state mills were ceded on easy terms, usually to friends and connections—not the best arrangement, but one that in effect subsidized businessmen and permitted a fresh start. Around the same time, cotton merchants turned from hand-spun yarn to machine spinning.f Between 1886 and 1894, thirty-three new mills were founded, over half of them in the Osaka area; and from 1886 to 1897, total value of yarn output increased fourteen times, from 12 million to 176 million yen. By 1899, Japanese mills were producing some 355 million pounds of yarn; by 1913, 672 million pounds. The effect was to close out imports and move over to exports

Cotton spinning was a relatively easy gateway into modern industry, as shown by precocious performances in Catalonia, Egypt, and Brazil. One had only to buy the machines, normally from some British manufacturer, who would then send out the technicians to get them started and if necessary keep them running. Such mills could then supply domestic handloom weavers, and hocuspocus, the deed was done: one had the simulacrum of an industrial revolution

Early on, the Japanese determined to go beyond consumer goods. If they were to have a modern economy, they had to master the heavy work: to build machines and engines, ships and locomotives, railroads and ports and shipyards. The government played a critical role here, financing reconnaissance abroad, bringing in foreign experts, building installations, and subsidizing commercial ventures. But more important were the talent and determination of Japanese patriots, ready to change careers in the national cause; and the quality of Japanese workers, especially artisans, with skills honed and attitudes shaped by close teamwork and supervision in craftshops. This legacy paid off in quick learning. Waterpower for industrial use did not come in until the last years of Tokugawa, when the Japanese adapted it to textiles particularly. Yet waterpower was never so important as in European or American industry, because the Japanese were already moving on. Steam technology was available, with electricity close behind. Electric power especially suited light industry and small, dispersed workshops; no other form of energy delivered such small amounts as needed. To be sure, electricity called for large-scale generation and distribution. This did not pose a problem in urban areas. In remoter country districts, beyond the grids, internal combustion engines did the job. Japan, then, moved into the second industrial revolution with an alacrity that belied its inexperience, generating and using electricity almost before it had gotten used to steam.* Arc lamps in Japan first lit up in 1878

a teacher at Kobu University, an engineering school founded in 1877 and later merged into Tokyo University. From his mix of study and practice, Fujioka saw the need for a central power station and sought private backing. When the first businessmen he approached declined, he went to a high government official from his home province. The official brought him together with a venture capitalist, and the two put together a syndicate of some sixty-four investors—former aristocrats, businessmen with official connections, and wealthy provincial merchants. So was born the Tokyo Electric Light Company ( T E L C ) . At first T E L C built small private generating and lighting facilities for factories, business firms, and shipyards. It went on, beginning in 1887, to supply electricity to the general public. That same year similar companies started up in Kobe, Kyoto, and Osaka; two years later in Nagoya and Yokohama—thirty-three companies in all by 1896. By 1920, primary electric motors accounted for 52.3 percent of the power capacity in Japanese manufacturing. The comparable American figure was 31.6 percent in 1919, reaching 53 percent only in 1929. Great Britain was even slower, with 28.3 percent in 1924.8 In respect of energy and power, then, Japan confirms the catch-up model: It pays to be

The traditional account of Japan's successful and rapid industrialization rings with praise, somewhat mitigated by distaste for the somber and intense nationalist accompaniment—the ruthless drive that gave the development process meaning and urgency. This was the first nonWestern country to industrialize, and it remains to this day an example to other late bloomers. Other countries sent young people abroad to learn the new ways and lost them; Japanese expats came back home. Other countries imported foreign technicians to teach their own people; the Japanese largely taught themselves. Other countries imported foreign equipment and did their best to use it.

The European countries that followed England on the path of modern industry had their own labor problems and scandals, though less serious, largely because they had had warning and were able to introduce protections by anticipation. By comparison, Japan rushed into a raw, unbridled capitalism. As in England, but more so, cottage industry was already the scene of shameful exploitation. Why do I say "more so"? Because the Japanese home worker was able and willing to put up with hours of grinding, monotonous labor that would have sent the most docile English spinner or pinmaker into spasms of rebellion. The Japanese, for example, had no day of rest, no sabbath. Why did they need one? Animals did not get a day of rest. Nor was the backwardbending labor supply curve—the preference for leisure over income— a serious problem in Japan

A large share of school time was devoted to the study of ethics; in a country without regular religious instruction and ceremonial, school was the temple of virtue and morality. As a 1930 textbook put it: "The easiest way to practice one's patriotism [is to] discipline oneself in daily life, help keep good order in one's family, and fully discharge one's responsibility on the j o b . " 1 0 Also to save and not waste. Here was a Japanese version of Weber's Protestant ethic, the more effective because it jibed so well with atavistic peasant values. The classical peasant is a miser who saves everything, and plans and schemes and works accordingly. He lives for work and by work adds to his holding; that is his reason for being. (The precocious separation of British cottage workers from the soil and agriculture was an advantage to industry, but in some ways the attitudinal effects were negative. The landless industrial worker works to live. When he has enough, he stops to enjoy.

Along with government initiatives and a collective commitment to modernization, this work ethic and these personal values made possible the so-called Japanese economic miracle. It was as though an entire population subscribed to bygone samurai values—the banalization of bushido. It would be a mistake of course to see this belief system as universal, but any serious understanding of Japanese performance must build on this phenomenon of culturally determined human capital. It was the national persona that generated a harvest of ingenious adaptations of Western technologies, that made much of litde, that drew extraordinary output from people who, in other societies, would have resorted to massive sabotage and exit. Those who wonder at the resistance opposed by Japanese armed forces in the closing months of World War II and ascribe it to fanaticism or suicidal impulse are missing the point. This is a society whose sense of duty and collective obligation, in all realms, sets it apart from the individualism cultivated in the West. Individualism was an enormous advantage in the pursuit of economic wealth in the centuries preceding the Industrial Revolution, not only in Europe but, as we have seen, in Tokugawa Japan. But once the Japanese saw the path they wanted to follow, their collective values proved a fabulous asset. (And a gross temptation.

The Turkish variant was succession by the ablest, later by the oldest, son.

That ship and a few others like it could have blown the Ottoman fleet (and the Venetian to the bargain) out of the water before it got close enough to ram or grapple. Meanwhile the Ottomans tried to keep up by importing large quantities of war materiel: muskets, gunpowder, saltpeter, iron, blades. In spite of papal interdictions on arms sales to Muslims, in defiance of clerical anathemas and excommunications, much of this armament came from England, which also sold to Spain

Over time, trade relations between Europe and the Levant reversed. Eastern craftsmen had once supplied Europeans with fine cloth, carpets, tapestries, faience, and the like in exchange for metal (copper and tin), slaves, and money. From the sixteenth century on, Europe made and sold the manufactures in exchange for dried fruit, spices, cotton, cereal. The same for silk: in the Middle Ages Europe had bought Byzantine silk fabrics; now it imported raw silk, and local producers in Turkey found it hard to compete with European buyers for the raw material. And paper: this writing material was eagerly adopted in the Middle East (eighth century) from Chinese example; forage was short, hides were scarce, and so was parchment. The new technology took root slower in Europe, where parchment was relatively abundant; but once European makers learned to produce paper, they far surpassed their Levantine predecessors and were soon selling large quantities in the East.8 Even such substances as coffee and sugar that had originally come to Europe from the East now went the other way—in the case of sugar, after refining and processing

The Ottoman state was a plunder machine which needed booty or land to fuel itself, to pay its way, to reward its officer class."1 0 The Ottomans had originally filled a power vacuum—had taken over a region once strong, now enfeebled—looting as they went. Now they could no longer take from outside. They had to generate wealth from within, to promote productive investment. Instead, they resorted to habit and tried to pillage the interior, to squeeze their own subjects. Nothing, not even the wealth of high officials, was secure. Nothing could be more selfdestructive. The only thing that saved the empire from disintegration was its inefficiency, the venality of its officials, and the protective interests of stronger powers. In these circumstances, the continued advance of European technology, in particular the Industrial Revolution, nailed shut the coffin of Ottoman industry. Except for some local specialties, nothing could stand up to cheap factory-made cottons and silks. The nineteenth century saw Britain protect the Ottoman empire from the territorial ambitions of its adversaries, while blithely killing off its manufactures. But from the British point of view, that was as it should be: British goods were cheaper, and the Ottomans could not possibly compete. They did not know enough; they did not have the capital; they could not count on political stability.

Muhammad Ali envisioned this development as a total process, encompassing advances in agriculture and industry, new technologies, innovations in schooling (what the economist would call improvements in human capital); also, and unfortunately, an arms program and the inculcation of martial virtues. To accomplish all this, he brought in foreign technicians, some of whom left Christianity for Islam. Although Britain clearly led the world in manufacturing, most of these experts were French, perhaps because the collapse of the Napoleonic empire had freed up talent, perhaps because France's defeat made it less redoubtable, perhaps because Muhammad Ali correcdy saw Britain as an opponent of Egyptian industry

In 1822, Jumel transplanted a bush he had found on the He Bourbon (later renamed Réunion) and developed for Egypt the cotton we know by his name.1 1 This species has a very long fiber, thin and yet tough, spinnable in combed form and suitable to the finest yarn and cloth.* In the new world of mechanized cotton manufacture, jumel cotton was a winner from the start. Muhammad Ali had it grown on his own estates, which occupied an increasing share of Egypt's best soil, and his officials quickly followed his example. By 1824, over 11 million kilograms were exported; by 1845, the figure was 15.5 million kilograms.1 2 It was the earnings from jumel cotton, bought (expropriated) at artificially low prices and marketed through state monopolies (roughly half of total Egyptian exports in 1835), that paid for Ali's economic and military ambitions and for much of the Suez Canal. The rest came from other crops, also sold by official agencies. This was a quiet way to generate revenue without levying uncollectable taxes. The system drove European merchants wild. Beginning in the 1820s, a good part of these earnings flowed into a massive educational and industrial effort—into technical and military schools, and a wide variety of mills and shops for the manufacture of textiles, metals and metal products, chemicals, rope, arms, ships, and the like—all the things necessary to replace imports and feed a growing war machine. The viceroy even sought a deeper independence by buying European machines and copying them in Egypt. In the face of British export prohibitions, the Egyptians got permission in 1826 to import five hundred power looms from Galloway's in Manchester

The British, in other words, had no reason to fear the competition of Egyptian manufactures. In spite (or because) of absurdly low wages, Egyptian costs were higher; and for all the fineness of the raw material, the quality of the final product was lower. But the British were immensely vexed by Ali's monopoly of the export cotton crop and by the barriers to import of foreign cotton goods into Egypt. So, with the help of the viceroy's own miscalculations and extravagant political ambitions, they forced free trade upon him. Scholars of "progressive" bent see this as the assassination of Egypt's industrial revolution, or at the least a measure that stalled Egyptian industrialization for another century. The assumption here is that industrialization cannot succeed without "tariff protection, tax exemptions, rebates on transport rates, cheap power, special credit facilities to certain sectors, educational policies, etc., which only a government enjoying a large measure of political and fiscal independence can provide."1 8 My own sense is that all of this is wishful thinking. Muhammad Ali's Egypt ready for an industrial revolution? No . His grand project already lay moribund when the new commercial treaty went into effect. To be sure, the old pasha went on investing in industrial plant right up to his death in 1848; but the military incentive was gone, and he was just throwing good money after bad. Nor did tariffs hold the key. The Japanese had no protective tariffs from the 1850s to the new century. They were not happy about this. But they prospered. (Note that the anti-imperialist historians want to have it both ways: now they complain that Egypt could not shelter its infant industries; now they boast that these industries were doing so well that they could sell their products abroad and that their European competitors were quaking before them.) All of this is fantasy history. Some of it reproduces an earlier time's enthusiasms

It is remarkable, in retrospect, that the last cohort of American Cold Warriors in power had walked into the same quagmire in the Middle East in 2001–3 as their predecessors had in Vietnam. The lessons of the past were overridden or unlearned. Instead of withdrawing from Afghanistan after their spectacular victory, the Bush administration unfurled the slippery and unrealizable goals of nation-building and democratization. The result of this quixotic effort was two decades of unwinnable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that cost 3 trillion dollars while the Western-funded and trained ‘civil society’ of the Afghans either fled in the face of the return of the Taliban or became its victim.3 Even more consequential was the tragic and misguided ‘reform’ of Iraq that reopened its sectional-religious divides, unleashed years of bloody civil strife, and produced ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), a new Islamist movement commanded by officers of Saddam Hussein’s army, which the Americans had defeated and ousted.

In the 1950s, America had opened its markets to its former enemies so that they did not fall to communism and chaos, and it had worked remarkably, thanks to many supportive factors. In the 1990s, the West opened its markets to communist China and helped it to build a modern industrial-technological base, ignoring the ghosts of Tiananmen Square. But the expectation that economic and trade symbiosis between the two giants would eventually make China increasingly look like America was a grand delusion. The levers of economic and financial controls in China remained in the hands of ‘Red families’, members of the senior Chinese communist leadership, who had successfully combined Leninist politics and liberal economics. China’s historical memories and its leadership’s long-term intentions were bound to drive the two empires apart.

Pro-Western euphoria was strong among Russians; Yeltsin and his supporters regarded the West, particularly the United States, as a teacher and a partner. They claimed that Russia had played the decisive role in destroying communism and a totalitarian state. Scholars continue to debate what happened to make this moment fade away, replaced by a chauvinist and imperialist upsurge. Many in the West argued, retrospectively, that ‘path dependency’ in Russian history was too great. To put it simply, the country that had hardly ever lived under a functioning parliamentary liberal democracy was doomed to slide back to authoritarianism and thereby to its old demons of imperialist greatness. There are also many disgruntled Russian liberals who argue – also retrospectively – that the democratic moment in Russia was wasted. They find that without a complete purge of the old elites, the re-emergence of autocrats, namely Vladimir Putin, was inevitable. A few Russian liberal politicians, however, point to the unfortunate collaboration between reformist leadership and Western governments that, instead of rapid progress, led to backsliding. Indeed, Russian GDP slid down by over 40 per cent, over half of the employed population was thrown into poverty, and Soviet-era safety nets, such as free crèches, kindergartens, schools, and medicine disappeared. Life expectancy, particularly for males, dropped to record lows for any developed country in peacetime. Market forces and consumption levels only began to pick up in Moscow and other large cities around 1997, but then a default, caused by unregulated financial speculation, erased people’s savings for the second time since 1991.

The Clinton administration sought to bring Russia into the Western orbit and bet on Yeltsin and a younger crop of Russian liberal technocrats. On balance, however, the US government did not do enough to steady Russia on its pro-Western track. And some US policies weakened Russian reformers and nourished anti-Americanism. Those policies, just like in the Middle East, repeated the mistakes of American Cold War practices and ignored the bitter lessons of the past. One such lesson was the US experience in non-democratic countries in the global south. American support of pro-Western but corrupt leaders had only made the US more unpopular, produced more corruption,

Clinton made a similar error in Russia: he had a personal relationship with ‘Tsar Boris’ Yeltsin, and this made the White House support Yeltsin as the ultimate ‘guarantor of Russian democracy’ and approve his coup of 1993, and later his war against the breakaway republic of Chechnya in 1994–95. It would have been better for all had America instead promoted institutional checks and balances in Russia, rather than backing ‘their guy’ in the Kremlin. This would have better preserved their reputation as ‘honest friends’ among Russian pro-Western elites. Instead, the Americans and their Russian reformist partners came to be associated with Yeltsin’s disastrous rule.

In 2007, Putin had already begun to try to get off what he perceived as the American hook: he no longer wanted to be a US partner on American terms. At an international forum on European security in Munich, Putin attacked the unipolar world order and came up with a list of grievances against US hegemony. He also called NATO enlargement a violation of promises made to Gorbachev in 1990.

The economic dimension of US relations with Russia was, from the start, delegated to international and non-government organizations, and private businesses and entrepreneurs. The logic of Mercury in Russia, however, worked in a skewed way, the very opposite of the way it worked in China. In the stable authoritarian China with its cheap, educated labour, the US corporations made the US government subordinate American national interests to business interests. Russia, with its rapidly shrinking economy and financial free-for-all, attracted primarily American seekers of quick profit, not serious investors. From a business angle, Russia seemed like a secondary country, one that could be ignored.

especially in the post-Cold War security and economic structures in Europe. During German reunification, Western powers worked out an informal understanding with Gorbachev and the Soviet military that NATO would not be expanded eastwards to include Poland and other countries beyond Germany. The sudden Soviet collapse created a new situation: the West could not ignore a geostrategic vacuum in eastern Europe. To complicate this ambiguity, the Russian government signalled to NATO leaders that Russia wanted to be first among equals among the new members of the Atlantic alliance. Yeltsin warned of the flipside of his offer: an expansion of NATO without Russia could paint him and Russian pro-Western forces into a corner and feed the surging nationalist and communist opposition.

George H.W. Bush’s White House understood the strategic risks involved in choosing eastern European security over a partnership with Russia. Experts correctly assumed that the expansion of NATO would immediately create a new security dilemma in eastern Europe, undermining pro-Western liberals in Russia and eventually imposing on Washington a commitment to defend countries of which the US public rarely heard.

the innovative idea of a ‘Partnership for Peace’ that would include all eastern European and post-Soviet countries, including Russia. Nothing was more important, they claimed, than keeping a nuclear Russia, however weakened, in partnership with the United States.5 Clinton’s impromptu decision in 1993 to invite Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to join NATO upended these careful calculations and ended the strategic ambiguity. The American foreign policy community, and the Clinton administration itself, became badly split over this new idea. George Kennan penned a sharp critique of NATO enlargement into eastern Europe. With uncanny clairvoyance, he predicted that the ‘open door’ expansion would ultimately bring NATO to the borders of Russia and trigger a war over Ukraine.

Soviet Union and Russia had often played the role of the Other to the concept of Europe and Euro-Atlanticism, especially during the Cold War. In the early 1990s, Yeltsin and Moscow liberals still hoped they could overcome this bias and turn their country into a member of the Euro-Atlantic ‘concert’. They ended up disappointed and frustrated. US hegemony, Yeltsin began to suspect, was at the root of Washington’s reluctance to accept Russia as a full member of its alliance. NATO’s first secretary general, Lord Ismay, had defined its triple mission as follows: ‘To keep Americans in [Europe], Germans down, and Russians out.’

There is something unchanging about human nature and conflicts. Exiled general and self-made historian Thucydides famously wrote in the 5th century BC that the war among the Greeks was the result of ‘the rise of Athens, and fear that this produced in Sparta’. Fear, honour, and interest – for Thucydides those qualities were natural, and naturally contributed to the tensions between the Greeks. Twenty-five centuries after Thucydides, French novelist Marcel Proust observed the naivety of those who expect wars to only erupt when countries are not satisfied with their borders and territories. War has countless causes. Seeing the ‘other’ as an enemy, a need for moral superiority, ideological delusions – all of these contribute to conflicts between countries. Insecurity is an irrational feeling that tends to become paranoia. And conflict almost inevitably breeds the conviction that the only way to settle a dispute is through the force of arms, pre-emptive offensives,

Those calamities shattered many illusions about security, liberal values, and capitalist economy.

The standard narrative outline in most American histories of the Cold War is that the United States, thanks to its overwhelming superiority, entrepreneurial and democratic values, thriving economy, and cooperation with strong allies, successfully contained the Soviet Union and ultimately triumphed in Europe and elsewhere. There is much truth to this, but this narrative is too deterministic and reflects a winner’s vantage point. Curious readers may wonder why capitalism did not prevail in the 1950s or 1970s.

Gorbachev’s rush to end the conflict, however, remains much less understood. Gorbachev could have bowed out of the Cold War like China. Instead, he offered a radically idealistic joint project: a nuclear-free world and a ‘common European home’ based on the convergence of democratic capitalism and democratic socialism. Gorbachev brought back genuine socialist idealism, but the rapid dissolution of Soviet power, triggered by unsuccessful reforms, buried the last sparks of this idealism.

Gorbachev, a visionary peacemaker and socialist reformer, ended up as a supplicant of Western financial assistance. The United States, with its Western allies, suddenly became the only pole in a new global order. In the West, pessimism and the exaggeration of Soviet power gave way to triumphalism and hubris.

Stark confrontation gave way to reversals and about-faces, elusive promises, and ambiguous policies. Both superpowers suffered from internal crises of faith. In the Soviet Union, communist ideology became ossified after the denunciation of Stalin and the suppression of the ‘Prague Spring’ in Czechoslovakia. American society was split over the Vietnam War and shocked by the Watergate scandal. Many believed that the US was losing the Cold War.

The second part is ‘The Time of Vulcan’, Vulcan being the maker of weapons in the Roman pantheon. This period marked the peak of the conflict. Stalin died in 1953, and there was hope that the confrontation might ease, both in Europe and in Asia, into a truce between the great powers. The main driver of this vision was the threat of thermonuclear ‘revolution’ that made an extinction of humanity possible. Ultimately, both sides focused not on negotiations, but on the arms race and shoring up their respective blocs. The Soviet leaders did this by launching Sputnik and sending tanks into Hungary in November 1956. NATO had its own crisis in the same month over Suez, yet American economic contributions and markets were too important for western Europeans to lose. Western Europe also began to discover the economic and political benefits of a common market, under the US nuclear umbrella. The thermonuclear revolution, instead of nudging the opposite sides towards a compromise, pushed them to build massive nuclear arsenals to deter each other.

Only the alliance between the leading capitalist democracies and Stalin’s Soviet Union could ensure the defeat of Germany, but this alliance was bound to lead to the occupation and split of Europe, prostrate and powerless, into two zones of influence. Washington, Moscow, and London trod cautiously, yet the urgency to build an order in Europe, above all in Germany, made them take steps, such as the Marshall Plan, that split the continent and led to confrontation.

The triumphalist mood was punctured by the terrorist attacks of 9/11, yet this tragedy did not shatter the enthusiasm about the global liberal order. On the contrary, the United States attempted to convert even the Middle East to ‘democracy’. Twenty years later, the triumphal mood is over.

When the international economy crashed with the Great Depression from 1929 onwards, the British and the French preferred to retreat into the safety of their colonial trade blocs, leaving the struggling Germans and eastern Europeans to their own devices.2 Adolf Hitler took advantage of this.

The experience of the past was an even more powerful factor in shaping domestic and international politics. In Washington, Moscow, London, Paris, and Rome, policies and decisions were guided primarily by the experience of recent catastrophes, rather than by ideology.

Truman was not good at negotiations, preferring to tell the Soviets what should be done, in the Far East or in eastern Europe. From the Kremlin’s perspective, American power suddenly seemed to be everywhere, disrupting Stalin’s expansionist designs and recognizing no spheres of influence but their own. Truman’s secretary of state James Byrnes boasted he was going to peace talks with the Russians ‘with an atomic bomb on his hip’. Stalin did not take this boast lightly.

The United States, one historian writes, was ‘the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known’.7 That colossus financed, waged, and won what were effectively two enormous wars overseas, one in Europe, the other in the Pacific, while successfully building and financing a pioneering atomic project. The American economy had come roaring back from the Great Depression: it had produced more arms than the Axis powers and the Soviet Union combined and had supplied Soviet and British war machinery on land, at sea and in the air. Half of the world’s manufactured goods were ‘made in the USA’. It was a financial superpower that held two-thirds of the world’s gold reserves and three-quarters of all invested capital. Its navy commanded the Atlantic and the Pacific, and one half of the world’s shipping vessels carried the US flag. Much of this had resulted from the war-induced shrivelling of other powers, such as the United Kingdom,

The ‘American century’ was not just for millionaires, but for most American people (though, at the time, only the white ones). Europeans tasted American products and watched well-fed GIs with admiration and envy. Hollywood showed millions a polished version of the American world. American consumerism and mass culture defined modernity – and did it more attractively than the discredited Nazi newsreels, not to mention clumsy Soviet propaganda. All this meant the US had a unique appeal for famished and dispirited Europeans. Americans did not seek any conquests in Europe, they did not even want to stay there. Rather, many Europeans, in the apt expression of one scholar, were eager to invite them over; they wanted to become part of an ‘American empire’ of productivity, prosperity, and consumerism.

Myths of Anglo-Saxon superiority in a white democracy built by immigrants of European stock built a democratic, but also racist foundation for American foreign policy. Suppression of American Indigenous people, anti-Semitism, segregation and racial discrimination against Black people, Latinos, and Asians were as integral to American life in the 1940s as were grassroots egalitarianism, rejection of intrusive state bureaucracy, and Christian proselytizing.

In the Soviet Union, Stalin and his communist regime told people that their country was the glorious successor to a millennium of Russian history, and at the same time a model of social justice and a paragon of ‘all progressive humanity’. The problem lay in the stark gap between these aspirations for greatness and the reality of the country’s postwar misery. The mainstays of the regime, some Western observers in Moscow thought at the time, were closer to the autocratic Russia of the 19th century than to a paradise of workers and peasants.

The British empire still ruled over much of Africa, India, and what were then Burma and Malaya, and its commonwealth sprawled from Canada to Australia and New Zealand. The two world wars dealt mortal wounds to British imperial dominance. Four hundred and fifty thousand British citizens perished between 1940 and 1945. The economic losses were huge: the war cost the empire two-thirds of its exports, a quarter of its merchant marine, half of its overseas investments, and a quarter of its financial reserves. The greatest blows were the humiliating defeats against Japan in Southeast Asia.

In the ‘Big Three’, as the trio of Allied leaders came to be known, Churchill was a secondary partner to Roosevelt and Stalin, and tried to cultivate each behind the other’s back. Churchill’s principal goal was to preserve the British empire and keep the Russians away from the Balkans and the Mediterranean. As the war brought the Red Army into eastern and central Europe, the British grew worried; they imagined Stalin carrying out the old programme of Russian imperialist expansion and feared the Soviet threat to Crete and the Suez Canal, resulting in an end to British control over the routes to India and Hong Kong.

Roosevelt and his advisers expected that, after the war, the Soviet government would not be able to ignore people’s demands for a better life and, like everyone else, would turn to the United States for credit and assistance. Stalin knew this. He said in his close circles that Churchill ‘would slip a penny out of your pocket’; Roosevelt, he said, ‘is not like that. He dips his hand in only for bigger coins.’

Without Roosevelt the inclusive Yalta order stood no chance. His successor Truman had a soft spot for ‘Uncle Joe’, as he called Stalin, but adopted a low-tolerance policy towards Soviet imperialism. The British leaders were glad to support this new course. In July 1945, Churchill lost out in the general election, to the Labour candidate Clement Attlee, but in March 1946, he would arrive in the US as Truman’s guest, to give a commencement speech in a local college in Fulton, Missouri. In his now-famous ‘Iron Curtain’ speech, Churchill proposed a post-war alliance between the United States and the peoples of the British Commonwealth. Aligning the British empire with enormous American power would bolster the former and would check Russian ambitions everywhere.

Stalin regarded the Fulton speech as a collusion of ‘the Anglo-Saxon powers’ against the Soviet Union. For decades Soviet propaganda would consider this speech the starting point of a new confrontation. The term ‘Cold War’ was not used. Instead, the Kremlin preferred to call it ‘a departure from the Yalta post-war order’. The ‘Fulton line’ was intended to replace this order with an alliance between the United States and the British empire, aimed against Soviet security interests. This was an unpleasant surprise for Stalin, who took pride in his ability to side with one ‘group of imperialists’ against the other and obtain concessions from both. Suddenly, there was nobody to side with. In the international power game between February 1945 and March 1946, the United States was like a joker in a card game: it transformed from Stalin’s partner to his most formidable antagonist.

Stalin annexed the lands that Hitler had given him as his ‘sphere of influence’ in 1939, including the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which became ‘republics’ within the Soviet Union. Two-thirds of Poland, and parts of Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, were attached to the Soviet republics of Byelorussia and Ukraine, constituent parts of the USSR. Eastern Europeans considered themselves victims of the ‘Yalta order’ and blamed the British and the Americans for this betrayal of their interests and freedom.

future of Poland was a much larger bone of contention. Modern Poland was resurrected in 1918, on the rubble of three empires, and viewed itself as a shield and spear protecting Europe from Soviet expansion. The Soviet–German pact and later a ‘treaty of friendship’ dismembered and destroyed Poland. When Stalin joined Roosevelt and Churchill as a member of the Big Three, the sordid past had to be swept under the rug, at least for as long as the Russians were ‘on the good side’ of history. Churchill desperately sought to convince Stalin to restore Poland’s independence. Stalin and his diplomats responded with an existential argument: Poland had always been a rival of Russia.

In Romania and Bulgaria, Stalin did not even bother to do what he had done in Poland. The Soviet leadership viewed those countries, formerly within the German zone of influence, as the keys to Soviet security in the Black Sea. The secret police made members of the pre-war political elites disappear or flee westward. The Soviet ruler was convinced that the United States would not quarrel with him over those countries, in an area far from American trade interests. He was wrong: Washington would scrutinize Soviet encroachments in any part of the world, even the lands which Americans could not properly find on the map. The US diplomats and military began to make plans to respond to Soviet ‘aggression’ anywhere: from the Black Sea to the Pacific, from the Arctic to Palestine.

Stalin’s main goals were to gain Soviet control over the Turkish straits, where Europe meets Asia and the Black Sea has a narrow egress into the Mediterranean. In Iran, Stalin wanted oil concessions, like the British had earlier gained. Complicating his games, the Kremlin ruler covered his geopolitical demands with the fig leaf of ‘national self-determination’. He pressed the Turks to cede contested territories that Georgians and Armenians had once peopled. In Iran, the Red Army had occupied the northern territories since 1941, per consensus with the British and the United States; Stalin took advantage of this by setting up Azeri and Kurdish ‘autonomies’ in the zone of occupation, dependent on Soviet support. He pressed the Iranian government to get the deal sealed, but Iranian politicians resisted Russian imperialism and turned to the British and the Americans for support. Stalin assumed that in the age of imperialism he could act like the Russian tsars had done in the past. He did not want to export communism; he wanted to have a territorial buffer of dependent states and statelets along the Soviet borders. Stalin miscalculated, because his policies aroused US suspicions and clashed with the American idealist vision. The new world order Americans imagined did not have room for Moscow’s imperialism.

The Kremlin dictator expected that the Yalta order could be preserved only through hard bargaining and demonstrations of strength, not concessions. This approach, however, only helped to cement the US–British alignment. Time after time, first in the Middle East, then in Europe, Stalin overreached and then had to retreat – without admitting his miscalculation. He retreated because he was not ready for an open confrontation with the Americans and still hoped to delay any such showdown. Before long, Stalin’s spies obtained a copy of Kennan’s telegram; Soviet intelligence reported on the change in Washington’s attitudes.

The Soviet Union, for all Stalin’s bravado, was weakened; the formidable Red Army had shrunk due to demobilization, illness, and sheer exhaustion. There was no military threat from Moscow to western Europe or even the Middle East. In his telegram, Kennan had acknowledged this. He wrote that the Soviet regime, in contrast to Hitler, did not have a fixed timetable for war and conquest: Russian communists believed that capitalism was doomed. In his diaries, Kennan wrote with confidence that ‘we can contain Soviet power until Russians tire of this game’.

Sparta feared the rapid ascendancy of Athens. In 2017, Harvard political scientist Graham Allison popularized this ancient story by writing about ‘Thucydides’s Trap’.19 He wrote that a war could emerge just from fear that a new power could displace the dominant one in a crucial region of the world. The Soviet–American–British triangle produced exactly such a trap in 1945–46. The British were pivotal to this triangle: their waning as a great power made the vacuum palpable, and by aligning with the US, they tipped the balance of fear. In a devastated Europe, hegemony was up for grabs and there were only two contenders: the Americans and the Russians.

The Cold War emerged in the way it did largely because the Americans ‘did what they wanted’ and Stalin refused to ‘do what he must’. This is not to say that the Americans launched the confrontation and that the Soviet Union was the passive side. Rather, the Americans had real means and ways to become a dominant power on both sides of the Atlantic. They had the strongest economy, fleets of strategic bombers, a huge navy, and the biggest money pot in the world at their disposal. And they had the atomic bomb. Those Western authors who have claimed that the Americans had to act to save Europe from Stalin have exaggerated the threat. Europe did not fall for communism after the First World War, and was not going that way after the Second World War, despite economic misery, political turmoil, and large communist parties in Italy and France. I side with those who claim that the Cold War was caused by the American decision to build and maintain a global liberal order, not by the Soviet Union’s plans to spread communism in Europe. US policymakers did not want to return to the failed international system that had rested on balance between great empires. Instead they decided they were on a mission to build a new international order. In particular, they sought to resurrect the liberal capitalist Europe that had been destroyed by Hitler and fascism, and to contain and weaken the Russians.

PaaS (Platform as a Service) includes the infrastructure of IaaS. But there is also middleware, which is the software that operates between the OS and the applications. These are the application servers, database management systems, messaging applications and authentication. PaaS will allow for the communication between these services. Besides middleware, there are other services provided. You get access to development tools, like IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), as well as data encryption, load balancing, automated updates, monitoring and analytics.

Costs The expenses tend to be lower than IaaS, since there is no need to pay for licenses for numerous software applications.

For this, you will use Node.js and Socket.IO. By using Elastic Beanstalk, you will put the coding in app.js, the dependencies in package.json and create a folder for the configuration. After you upload this, Elastic Beanstalk handles everything like creating an EC2 instance, load balancing, autoscaling, and SSL management.

"What is rich?" asks a merchant banker of the Persian Gulf: Rich is education . . . expertise . . . technology. Rich is knowing. We have money, yes. But we are not rich. We are like the child who inherits money from the father he never knew. He has not been brought up to spend it. He has it in his hands; he doesn't know how to use it. If you do not know how to spend money, you are not rich. We are not rich. Without this knowledge, this understanding, we are nothing. We import everything. The bricks to make houses, we import. The men who build them, we import. You go to the market, what is there that is made by Arabs? Nothing. It is Chinese, French, American . . . it is not Arab. Is a country rich that cannot make a brick, or a motorcar, or a book? It is not rich, I think.

The poor call for solidarity, but the rich have more immediate worries. They feel insecure, for wealth sleeps badly in a bed of poverty.

Many Middle Eastern specialists, keen to defend Islam against (Western) denigration or condescension, insist that Muslim gender relations, though shaped by religious doctrine, are in great part independent of it. Among their arguments: these rules and practices go back to pre-Islamic times, or were learned from non-Arab peoples, or were linked to income and status (rich men's wives did not have to work or shop), or were a response to the threats of urban life, shielding women against insults to personal and family honor. They have a point: If Islam were to disappear tomorrow, Arab men would still see women as they do today. Other scholars, sometimes the same, stress the allegedly hostile motivations of Western scholars: "orientalist" scorn and malevolence, "essentialist" ignorance and foolishness. The use of such pejorative code words is to dismiss rather than refute

Nor would I rest too much hope on the right to vote: for Arab politicians, especially the more conservative, the women's vote is a useful electoral card. The vote, yes; power, no. Arab Muslim men, it seems to me, have been largely unmoved by these small innovations and pockets of resistance. For one thing, the lessons are blurred by the readiness of many (most?) women to accept and defend the old ways.* For another, gender privileges will not be taken; they must be surrendered. It is male opinion and behavior that matter (the men run the show), and their quasi-unanimous sense of superiority is litde affected by occasional feminist challenges. The men will not be converted or intimidated by rniniskirts in Beirut, only scandalized and confirmed in their sense of women's dire, demonic corporality.t

Scholarly emotions run high on Middle Eastern matters. Readers and audiences know the answers in advance. Debates, often angry or sullen, are anything but debates. N o one is ready to check his gun at the door; it may be needed. Among the casus belli: the Arab-Israeli conflict; European economic imperialism, formal and informal; and Western criticisms (hence slanders) of Arab or Islamic culture, especially the treatment of women. In these circumstances, much of the debate has taken the form of name-calling. The purpose (or effect) of these labels is to marginalize or exclude the adversary. He is a . . . (fill in the classifier). Nothing more need be said. The most influential of these dismissive strikes has been the invention of "orientalism." This is the sin of writing about Asia, but especially the Middle East, from the outside, that is, from the standpoint of the condescending, hostile, exploitative West. Attacks on the once respectable fascination with things Eastern go back at least to the 1960s; but it was the publication in 1978 of Edward Said's book of this name (Orientalism) that gave the charges currency and called into question most Western writing on the Middle East.3 5 The bill of indictment ran as follows: 1.

Such pseudo-scholarship tends to stereotype in time and space. "Orientals"—the very designation is a Eurocentric imposition—are the same through the ages, and this essential sameness results from a perdurable Islam that "never changes." Hence the intellectual fellow-disease of "essentialism." Orientalists have no room for details, nuances, or texture. 3. Stereotyping lends itself to racism and prejudice. It separates one group from another, promotes arrogance on one side, resentment on the other. If we could get rid of "the Orient," we would have "scholars, critics, intellectuals, human beings, for whom the racial, ethnic, and national distinctions [are] less important than the common enterprise of promoting human community

The effort to purge the field of these factitious diseases has become an assault on knowledge. In the first place, the anti- "orientalist" method would exclude indispensable tools of inquiry. As any good comparativist knows, distinctions are the stuff of understanding. The anti-"orientalist" cannot have it both ways— denounce, that is, the pursuit of distinctive characteristics as "essentialist," while calling for an understanding of intergroup differences. It is this understanding that turns diversity into a sense of common humanity. Ironically, those very "orientalists" so roundly condemned here— those philologists, archeologists, and travelers, sand-smitten Westerners in Middle Eastern garb—were desperately in love with the Arab Muslim world. Some of them were searching for paradise lost. To quote from an epigraph to a recent book: "The attraction, the spell of Arabia, as it is so frequently called, is a sickness of the imagination."3 7 Today these orientalists are reproved as pretentious, racist imperialists. So much for their romance: no kindly sentiment goes unpunished

Secondly, the reality of nuance does not rule out the light that comes from generalization. Everything, to be sure, is more complex than appears. Every person, every event is unique. Even so, some effort must be made to simplify, to find patterns. Otherwise we have nothing but a grab bag of unrelated data. Thirdly, bad news is not necessarily wrong.

In the Middle Eastern anti-"orientalist" camp, the shibboleth is anti-Zionism. Any indulgence for Israel is proof of error and irrelevance, if not worse. Thus Edward Said and followers have worked to exclude and denigrate Bernard Lewis, a leading authority in the field, as "orientalist" and "essentialist," but also "too close to the Israeli cause to be regarded as capable of impartial judgment." To be sure, "Lewis has given as good as he has got. Nevertheless, Said's critique has found a body of support among Western scholars, while it has been echoed with relish by Islamists and others in the Middle East."3 8 On the other hand, some outside scholars qualify because they agree politically with the gatekeepers

apologists for the treatment of women in Muslim countries, or more accurately, for Arab Muslim culture, never fail to cite it by way of extenuation. If the Japanese could do so well while putting down their women, the argument runs, why label this a handicap in Muslim societies? And indeed, Japanese women have traditionally accepted inferior status, with direct economic consequences. They quit jobs after marriage and rarely reach posts that would put them in charge of men. Their very dress was traditionally designed to hobble them on the pretext of protecting their modesty and accenting their femininity. Their speech was differentiated and encumbered by a polysyllabic burden of deference; their voices were trained and tuned to a panting soprano squeak; their gestures drilled to a caricature of coy, tremulous humility. (Small wonder that Japanese men found consolation in bath- and other houses where they could meet more "natural" partners.)

In 1890, only 30 percent of eligible girls attended school; twenty years later, the figure was 97.4 percent.4 1 At the same time, women's actiivities changed to fit the needs of a new economy. More and more of them found jobs outside the home, primarily in light industry (textiles, etc.), where the workforce was 60-90 percent female. These branches produced 40 percent of the GNP and 60 percent of foreign exchange at the end of the nineteenth century.4 2 How were women wageearners going to rear and teach children? Answer: By leaving work upon marriage and focusing on household and family—unless of course they needed the earnings (a big "unless"). Priorities were the key: country and household first; gender next. As a result, the role of a woman was never simply reproductive. She was more than a vessel. She was a toiler, a consumer, a saver, a manager. And she always, both by right and by necessity, had access to public space. (The contrast here with Arab Muslim societies is striking and crucial.)

The word "colony" started innocentiy enough: in the ancient world it meant a place of distant settlement—the Phoenician colony of Carthage or the Greek colonies in Italy. But settlement, we now know, implies some kind of displacement (nothing is so scarce as empty land), hence cannot be good or virtuous, at least not for the victims; so that settlement as system (colonialism) is clearly bad

The whole island of Britain, in other words, is a palimpsest of successive invasions and seizures, most of which have blurred into a unitary society; although some members of the conquered Welsh and Scots populations still dream of earlier independence and distinctive identity. One can find similar foci of grievance in the Basque country of Spain (but less in that of France), in Catalonia and Corsica, in the debris of the old Habsburg and Romanov empires; and the current tragedy of Bosnia reminds us that memories of defeat and conquest do last, or can be reawakened and manipulated, and that life is short but revenge long. The Turks defeated the Serbs at Kossovo in 1389; the Turks have long forgotten, but the Serbs have made reversal of this defeat the lodestone of their national aspirations

The annexation and exploitation of these distant lands took many forms. For the Spaniards, the heart of the matter was treasure. Their empire consisted of veins of ore linked to local and regional supply lines of labor, food, and manufactures, and to sea lines stretching back to Europe. The Portuguese in Asia, on the other hand, worked in lands inhabited by much larger and, for them, unconquerable populations. They had to build on small, defensible holdings such as Goa—points of presence—and radiate from there, buying, selling, and extorting protection money from local merchants

Once installed, Dutch and British aimed at managed cultivation, going well beyond what nature provided. Empire is a story of botanical enterprise, moving crops to soils and climes of opportunity: sugar starting in the Indian Ocean and working round the globe to the Caribbean islands; tea transplanted from China to India and Ceylon (India tea vs. China tea); rubber seeds smuggled from Brazil and planted in Malaya; cinchona (source of quinine) from South America to St. Helena to Java; oleaginous plants from the New World to West Africa; coffee here, cocoa there. Here the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew on the banks of the Thames, a princess's hobby to start with, played a leading role—a model of science and commerce conjoined. All of this was more profitable and durable than pillage or extraction, though obviously no one objected to treasure trove—over the centuries, diamonds in India and South Africa, gold in Australia and Africa, oil in Burma and the East Indies

Private and special interests got in the way of rational, prudent intentions. The merchants themselves sought trade, not territory as such. They would have done business with the devil if it meant profits. But they did not want to be robbed or bullied by native dealers or officials, who saw all traders as potential prey. So when Europeans ran into trouble, they called on their home governments for help. Governments typically pitched in. To be sure, their starchy, largely incompetent representatives, selected more for family and political connections than for merit, adored form and protocol.* (The biographies of these stuffed shirts make one wonder how the British ever built and held an empire.

officials had their own care for promotions and enrichment. Empire drew such types, men who did not want to spend their lives as magistrate in some bucolic home county, men of pride and power and, if we are to believe the reports, men sometimes drawn by the sexual ambiguities and freedoms of an interracial, anomic world. These were not healthful climes, and many an official died early; they drank like fish, and alcohol is a poison. But vigorous, mettlesome men think themselves immortal.

over the centuries, bit by bit and bite by bite, the British, for example, found themselves picking up large and small pieces of territory: the whole of India, much of Burma, Canada all the way to the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, plus watering holes and refueling stations, strategic power points, refuges along the major trade routes and on the periphery of great markets (thus Gibraltar, Malta, St. Helena, Capetown, Bombay, Singapore, Hong Kong, Aden). Such places paid their cost and made a string of pearls around the globe. Some of them were prizes of imperial ambition; others, of mercantile interest.

imperialism was very busy during these decades, as the French Algerian venture (1830), the British occupation of India and advances in Burma, the Russian conquests in Siberia and the Caucasus, and the American expansion westward—among others—all showed. It was the historians who had a blind spot; that, and a doctrinaire notion that empire had to wait for the call of a mature (fading?) capitalism. This call, we were taught, explained the "New Imperialism." Beginning in the late 1860s, the growing indocility of the proletariat at home turned covetous eyes toward exploitable workers abroad. Africa in particular, but also pieces of Asia and Pacific islands, became targets of opportunity for all the major European nations. Among them, Germany, which belatedly decided that it could not be a world power without overseas possessions. When the dust had settied, all of Africa lay under one or another European government. The only exceptions: Liberia, an American project for returning blacks to their home; and Ethiopia, which the Italians tried to grab and failed

southern African gold mines drew a flood of rough-and-ready prospectors to the Transvaal, spawned disputes with the Afrikaner authorities, brought Britain into the quarrel, and led to the Boer War. Radical and skeptical observers denounced this late land grab as, first, the product of capitalist greed, and then of need—a prior condition of European prosperity. The first was partiy true. Greed now had free play—not necessarily capitalist greed, but simple human greed. Thanks to repeating rifles and machine guns, grabbing and killing were now easy—so easy that European brutes rejoiced at massacring natives like game birds and called them "brutes." (For so-called gentiemen, hunting was a school for brutality and cowardice. It still is.) Here is the young Winston Churchill, anticipating the imminent battie of Omdurman, revenge for Gordon at Khartum: " . . . a good moment to live," he wrote, and: "Of course we should win. Of course we should mow them down." And: "Nothing like the battle of Omdurman will ever be seen again. It was the last link in the long chain of those spectacular conflicts whose vivid and majestic splendour has done so much to invest war with glamour." Native peoples soon learned to disappoint their conquerors by giving up too quickly. N o killing; no medals and promotions

Some businessmen made money in these strange and distant places; many more did not. But European economies as economies gained little if anything from these exotic connections. Good businessmen knew it. When Belgium's King Leopold, venality wearing a crown, invited the German banker Gerson Bleichrôder to help with his huge domain in the Congo, Bleichrôder politely declined. He was as interested as any good banker in the opportunities of such a partnership, but he could spot a clinker a long way off. A few years later (early 1880s), Bismarck thought to pick up some pieces in far-off Africa and among the Pacific islands. Would Bleichrôder help? Here the banker had to be more forthcoming, because Bismarck was his private client and patron; even so, he asked for a guaranteed minimum return

Once-imperialist economies have prospered as never before. And most of the former colonial nations have found it hard to get on track. Their colonial masters, afraid of their incipient nationalism and contemptuous of their abilities, had not taught them much—barely enough to do the subaltern tasks of government. White rulers dreaded educated natives: detribalized, filled with "inappropriate" aspirations, they were, in the words of one British official (1886), "the curse of the [African] west coast."1 1 The British, for all their reliance on local elites, systematically excluded these déracinés (uprooted ones) from posts of responsibility in government and trade

although the colonialists often left behind an infrastructure of roads, ports, railroads, and buildings, maintenance was another matter. The ability of the ex-colonies to neglect and run down their material legacy was stunning, as visitors could attest. (The same thing happened in central and East European countries drawn into the inept bureaucratic world of socialism.)1 2 Much of what these subject populations learned in the schools and universities of the colonial master was political and social discourse rather than applied science and technical know-how—the makings of revolution rather than production. And maybe that was the first priority: freedom first, economy later; because freedom is a necessary if not sufficient condition of development

What's the balance sheet? Has imperialism been good or bad for subject peoples? Let me attempt a series of propositions: ( 1 ) A principal aim of imperialism has been to extract wealth and labor, more than was available at a free market price. The results have not always matched expectations. On the other hand, in (almost) every instance, a few people have done well—tough traders, concessionaires, functionaries, intermediaries (compradores), local elites—on both sides of the divide between rulers and ruled, stronger and weaker. (2) Almost all imperialisms have brought material and psychological suffering for the subject people; but also material gains, direct and indirect, intended and not. Some of these gains flowed from opening and trade. To cite John Stuart Mill, writing from a British/Smithian perspective in the middle of the nineteenth century, " . . . the tendency of every extension of the market [is] to improve the processes of production.

The colonials typically built useful things—roads, railroads, port facilities, buildings, water supply, waste disposal units, and the like. They made the natives pay for these improvements in labor and taxes, but they could have just kept the money. Meanwhile the gain to natives was incidental, for such improvements were made primarily for the ruling power and its commercial interests; after all, one had to make these distant places livable and profitable, defend the frontiers, maintain order. It was nonetheless gain. The same holds for health facilities, which initially served the masters (note, however, that roads and clearances could help spread disease). Yet motive matters less than consequences. N o one can segregate the benefits of such efforts. Also, builders and doctors had their own sense of duty to the larger society. Would more of these facilities have been built if these countries had been free? Under the precolonial regimes, unlikely. Even now, when development has become a universal religion and business enterprise stands ready to respond, public works in former colonies too often disappoint. Worse, successor regimes have allowed the colonial legacy to deteriorate. The great exceptions have been the postcolonial societies of East and Southeast Asia: South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore. And, of course, new technologies have made for inexorable improvement— airports and air transport, for example. In ex-colonies, however, such projects are often the conspicuous consumption of rulers who prefer to spend (other people's money) for new, rather than care for old. We are left with a succession of layers on the middens and ruins of an earlier generation. The usual archeological pattern of successive civilizations is now revived in the ill-prepared societies of the twentieth century and will presumably be the delight of future diggers. Among the future ruins: lavish hotels, already displacing caravanseries and the kind of inn that sets the stage for adventure novels and cinema

Let us try the counterfactual: the economically backward nations would have grown and progressed (in the sense of technique and productivity) faster had they never known colonialism. The argument pro rests on hypothesis: on the assumption that these subject peoples would otherwise have been free of domestic as well as of foreign exploitation; also able to learn and change. The argument con rests on history: imperialism has not prevented a few colonies from developing as autonomous centers and from learning and inventing the techniques of an industrial economy.2 0 Hence the British colonies in North America, Finland as part of the Russian empire, Norway under Sweden, Hong Kong under Britain. The first example of a non-Western nation to do so, Japan, though remaining independent (no small matter), did it under the tariff limits of an informal imperialism. But then again, as everyone knows, Japan is special

History suggests that tutelage can be a school. Of course, a lot depends on the teacher. Some imperial nations were better rulers than others and their colonies did better after independence. This criterion would have the Spanish and Portuguese bad, the Dutch and French less bad, and the British least bad because of their willingness and ability to invest in social overhead (railways in India, for example) and their reliance on local elites to administer in their name. In 1900, India had thirty-five times the railway mileage of nominally independent China—a salute to Britain's sense of imperium and duty.2 1 (A cynic might argue that these railways were intended primarily to get raw cotton and other primary products to port and soldiers to points of unrest. Still, the linking of Indian markets eased food distribution in a country vulnerable to local famines. And sometimes it might take a famine to get a line built

By this standard, however, the best colonial master of all time has been Japan, for no ex-colonies have done so well as (South) Korea and Taiwan, where annual growth rates per head from 1950 to 1973 exceeded those of the advanced industrial nations (Japan itself excepted). This achievement reflects in my opinion the culture of these societies: the family structure, work values, sense of purpose. (I say this even though many economists do not accord importance to culture, which cannot be measured and, for these experts, just gets in the way of good ideas

When freedom came, Koreans remembered. But they did not let memory get in the way of material development. "Don't get angry; get even." Korea and Taiwan are the exception. Most of the new postwar nations remembered too well and took the wrong path. The economic system of their former rulers was anathema: capitalism was seen as inefficiency laced with corruption and injustice. In the light of the Soviet victory in World War II, socialism cum dictatorship was the assurance of production and promise. They couldn't have been more wrong.

Looking back, then, on the imperialism experience, one sees a persistent conflict between theory and reality. For most of the past century, the ruling orthodoxy has been not simply anticolonialist. It has incorporated anticolonialism into a larger vision (explanation) of economic history: colonies as pillars of a dying capitalism. In this model, colonies paid, whether by nourishing the growth of imperialist economies or by transferring wealth from poor to rich—empire as vampire. Without colonies, bourgeois domination would come tumbling down. Or to put it differently, Europe could not afford to give up its colonies. Conversely, once the subject peoples free, they would rise swiftly to prosperity. Could not afford . . . Not at all. Over the course of the twentieth century, resistance to imperial masters grew. European ideals of freedom and the rights of man proved contagious, and subject peoples learned from their masters how to resist their masters. Meanwhile public opinion, once blithely supportive of empire, now deplored

World War II dealt the coup degrâce. Not only did Western nations lose their reputation of invincibility, but their war aims deprecated dominion. Now the burden of mastery grew unbearably heavy. Some countries, prouder than others, held on (France in Indochina and, even more, Algeria). Others (Britain in India and Palestine, Holland in Indonesia) could not wait to let go. They were right. To the disappointment of the anticolonialist doctrinaires, the ex-imperial nations suffered not a whit by the loss of these territories; on the contrary. The second thesis also proved to be wrong. In 1 9 6 1 , an Indian economist named Surendra Patel published an essay that demonstrated by irrefutable arithmetic that India, now free of the British Raj, would in some thirty years pass France in income per head, and in another few years, the United States.2 7 He was not alone; one could find other romantic predictions. They reflected fair hope and tenacious doctrine; also national pride and a kind of virtual revenge

The process is not a pleasant one for the losers, although the pain is much eased by willful myopia; also by the fact that these losses of place do not usually entail absolute decline.* On the contrary, earlier advances will have been converted into a stock of wealth that comforts those who have it; and into human and material capital that continues to yield income and growth.

Nothing shows this better than the conquest of England by William of Orange, Stadholder of the United Provinces, in 1688.

Some scholars cite mistakes of strategy: the Dutch stayed with Indonesia and spices while the British and then the French bet on India and textiles; or the Dutch mishandled their commercial ties with China and thus lost out on the lucrative tea trade; or the Dutch, for this and other reasons, lost ground in inter-Asian commerce. More persuasive is the argument from catch-up and convergence: other centers, advantaged by lower wages, learned to make the textiles and other manufactures that had been a mainstay of Dutch exports and shipping, and having learned, shut their doors against imports. In a world of mercantilist rivalry, navigation acts and protectionism were killing the old workshop and chief middleman. N o wonder the Dutch exported capital: they could get more for it abroad than at home

Britain succeeded Holland. In the seventeenth century, England harassed and fought the United Provinces at every opportunity: hence a tax on the export of unfinished woolens and Alderman Cockayne's Project (1614-17) to take back from the Dutch the valuable dyeing and finishing (unsuccessful);* two navigation acts, designed to hurt the Dutch in their role as chief carriers and middlemen (they did); and a pair of naval wars that displaced the Dutch as masters of the seas, extruded them from North America, and led indirectly to their containment in India. Then the Dutch placed William of Orange on the English throne (1688), and from then on, the two countries partnered in war and peace; but the Dutch were the junior partners. In particular, the Dutch were Britain's barrier to French territorial ambitions on the Continent. So useful were they in this role that, once the takeover by Revolutionary-Napoleonic France liquidated, the British gave back (1815) to the newly created Kingdom of the Netherlands its lost colonies, including Indonesia (one major exception: Cape Colony in South Africa). In the bargain came what is now Belgium, then a mosaic of the Austrian Netherlands and sundry bishoprics and principalities. The point was, Britain no longer had to fear Dutch economic rivalry. Whatever the Dutch had done, the British now did bigger and better

Josiah Child, London merchant, M.P., later governor of the East India Company, and political arithmetician, saw the issue clearly in his New Discourse of Trade (1668 and 1690): The prodigious increase of the Netherlanders in their domestick and foreign trade, riches, and multitude of shipping, is the envy of the present, and may be the wonder of all future generations. And yet the means whereby they have thus advanced themselves are . . . imitable by most other nations but more easily by us of this kingdom of England.1 6 Exactly.

After 1815 the British, sure of their hegemony, began abolishing the restrictions introduced in an earlier mercantilist spirit: thus prohibitions on export of machinery and emigration of artisans and some major tariff barriers and navigation acts. At the same time, using unimpeachable arguments about division of labor and gains from trade, they sought to persuade other countries to reciprocate. They did make some progress, but unfortunately for comparative advantage and classical doctrine, most other countries saw this as a device to keep them in their agricultural place. Free trade became British dogma and practice; most other countries flirted with it and found the water cold. Or perceived it as a British trap: if perfidious Albion wanted it, it couldn't be good.1 7 Meanwhile British industry throve in a world that wanted cheap manufactures. If European nations would not take these goods, buyers could be found on other continents, the more so as improved transport steadily lowered the cost of delivery. When in 1851 the British held the first worldwide exposition of technical and industrial achievement, they thought to celebrate their own mastery. They gave room and prizes to other, lesser nations, to be sure, but the principal theme was Britain as workshop to the world. And to the future: the very architecture of the Crystal Palace, hall to the exhibits, marked farewell to stone and brick and welcomed in a new age of iron and glass, of light and open space, of modular components and mechanized washings. It was the equivalent of the medieval shift from heavy Romanesque to vaulting Gothic

Serious unease set in toward the end of the century. It was linked to political changes signaling a shift in the balance of power: Germany's sudden rise to primacy on the Continent; its defeat of France in 1870 and establishment of a Deutsches Reich; its colonial ambitions in Africa and the Pacific; its projects of railway construction and trade in the Ottoman empire, which the British saw as threats to the India lifeline; the departure of the prudent, sagacious Bismarck and his replacement by a chauvinistic emperor who bullied his political advisers and resented his British cousins (so much for family ties); finally, Germany's decision to build a big navy, that is, to challenge Britannia's God-given right to rule the waves. All of this, moreover, rested on substantial economic gains: rapid growth of heavy industry (iron, steel, chemicals); special strength in the newer technologies (electricity, organic chemicals, internal combustion, and gas and oil motors); a banking sector exceptionally supportive of manufacturing and commercial enterprise; an educational system that was turning out large numbers of technicians, engineers, and applied scientists.

The economic merges with the political. A decline of relative economic strength (loss of market share, of industrial branches) means less political power, if only because armed forces cost money. The Britain of today is a far cry from the "Rule Britannia" of 1914-18 or even 1939-45. Such power as it has stems from possession of nuclear arms and its special tie, for what that is worth, with the United States. Now, hard as loss of relative wealth may be, it is not the pain of powerlessness.2 2 Nationalism is an expression of identity, and via identity, of dignity and self-esteem. When one's country becomes smaller, one's self becomes smaller. When one has known and enjoyed the greatness of Great Britain, ebb tide is hard to take. Perceptions rule here. Some scholars have wanted to treat this sense of loss as an illusion—like the one experienced by passengers in a stationary train who see another train going by and imagine they are moving in the opposite direction.2 3 Besides, does not this kind of loss flow inevitably from the growth of other powers? The world does not stand still, and the diffusion of technology and industry was bound to raise up new, and often bigger rivals.24 Britain could not but lose standing. But that does not make the loss easier to bear. Perception is subjective, and the dispassion of the scholar is like caviar to the general: it doesn't taste good. Appeals to national vanity, we are cautioned, are the work of politicians. "But they mislead us." After all, there can be only one top dog, only one number one. So, "if not being top is failure then Britain has been in good and abundant company . . . " But is that the same as losing first place? The pain, w are told, is sharpest for those who remember better days, especially when one recalls long-standing superiorities. It is one thing to see the United States richer and stronger. But France, Italy

An economy built on exports was losing its export markets. In response to labor unions and political pressure, the British government subsidized and socialized the old standbys—iron and steel, cotton textiles, coal. But no growth there. Just underemployed labor, encrusted practices, and torturous decline. As for new technologies and manufactures, well, jobs were opening up in lesser lines. The Cambridge economic historian J. H. Clapham pointed out that such a shift was normal: as branches close down, people have to leave them and move "to some expanding occupation, say, chocolate-making or chorus singing." He said this in 1942; had he been able to see the future, he would have spoken of the Beatles

Other comparisons—say autos or computers vs. movies or saxophonists—might yield a "yes," though not to all.2 8 Many of these new products do not have the same payoff in skills, knowledge, and high-wage jobs that high-tech items do. All of this raises a fundamental question: are some activities more fruitful than others? Economists are sharply divided on this, but the neoclassicists would insist that a dollar of hamburger is the same as a dollar of computer chip

Did British entrepreneurs miss opportunities to make more money because of want of character, knowledge, or rationality? The answer of the historical economist (the "new economic historian") was no: if Britain did less well than some other countries in, say, coal or steel or cotton manufacture, it was because it could not have done better. Coal deposits were not thick enough; better iron ores could wait while older, poorer ores were used up; faster spinning machines did not suit fine British yarn. Given competition, all had to be for the best in the best of all possible worlds. True, foreign rivals now ran faster and better machines and more of them. But new is not always cheaper, at least not for the early comer. Never underestimate the tenacity and ingenuity of older devices where touch and hand skills play a role lost with automation. Even where British equipment aged, it did not always pay to replace it. These older machines had already been paid for, and their net return might be higher than a new device's. New might be more productive, but it still had to be amortized.

some things were beyond the entrepreneur's control. External costs (related costs), for example, were greater in Britain, which was stuck with relatively narrow-gauge track, small freight cars, low bridges, narrow, winding roads. These installations had been built economically when volume was smaller. Now they reduced economies of scale and hurt mass production. Similarly, Britain had developed a system of commission brokers and multimark distributors between manufacturer and potential customers.3 0 These arrangements had once promoted division of labor. Now they got in the way of big deals

when all is said and done, the older data on individual branches, based as they were on direct measures, were far more accurate and reliable than aggregate constructs, as these same cliometricians conceded when their figments went against them. This happened as soon as the focus on British loss of leadership widened from the Victorian and Edwardian eras to include the period after World War I. Now, for the twentieth century, the comparative estimates of productivity, like the industry data, told a story of Britain's further loss of place. And now, suddenly, the optimists warned readers of the unreliability of macroestimates—of the "frailty of the calculations," of "errors and imprecision in measurement" and "very large margins of error"; and cautioned that national aggregates were a "fragile foundation" on which to build theories of British performance.3 4 One leading yea-sayer, more faithful to theory, did not even bother: he simply dismissed calculations of higher productivity in other countries (say, the United States) as trivial or incredible: why should such large gaps exist and persist?3 5 But, of course, they do exist. They just don't persist. The annals of competition show entire national branches dragging and withering

Britain's spirit of enterprise suffered for want of opportunity and expansion. "Because [Britain] already had a large industrial plant which in many branches was adequate to the demands made upon it in the '80's and '90's, the incentive to install new capacity and the opportunity of trying out new methods were circumscribed."3 6 So we have change in slow motion: why rush to put in electrical lines if one already has an excellent supply of gas lighting? (Answer: Electricity is better and safer, if less romantic; also much more versatile.) Especially if municipal authorities have sunk large sums into gas production and distribution.3 7 (More related costs and vested interests.)

Succession of control is a difficult and invidious process, pitting insiders against outsiders, some insiders against others, blood against talent, blood against blood, talent against talent. At stake, decisions regarding choice of product and methods of production. Here the British were late in exploiting newer fields and ways, stressing instead learning by doing, in the shop and at the bench. Such job apprenticeship has its virtues and successes, but nothing is better calculated to preserve the old in aspic and miss the possibilities of innovation

The second industrial revolution misfired. The most egregious failure was the abortion of the protean industry of organic chemicals (dyestuffs, plastics, pharmaceuticals). Here Britain was actually the pioneer and leader, with strong advantage in the key raw material (coal tar) and in demand (the textile industry), but lost out for want of knowledge, imagination, and enterprise to Germany, Switzerland, even France.4 0 Management made no commitment to systematic research. R. J. Friswell, a working industrial chemist at the turn of the century, regretted (1905) that the men in charge of the chemical industry "looked upon all these [scientific] discoveries as isolated and not connected in any way . . . that they were discovered by lucky flukes

like France earlier, the Britain of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries cared more for pure science than its applications.4 2 Part of the difficulty lay in British schooling: the Continental countries had created technical and scientific institutions as a matter of policy, whereas Britain had let this kind of education grow like a weed and had treated it, once grown, like a poor relation of "proper" schools and universities.*

Some have explained the shortcoming by exogenous factors, notably culture. They have sought to explain Britain's retreat from hegemony by the triumph of an antibusiness, antimaterialist outlook and its negative consequences for recruitment.4 3 The teachers, poets, men and women of letters, and intellectuals—the people who set the tone and orchestrated the values—nurtured a sense of scorn for the shop and the office. The point was to rise above the material to higher things. Such pretensions found particular resonance among those older elites who found themselves josded by grubby newcomers, and of course among the grubby newcomers who wanted to degrub themselves.4 4 Snobbery is the revenge of the haughty and the humbug of the ambitious

A growth rate of 2.8 percent yields a sixteen-fold increase over the course of a century, as against 2,200 times for an annual rate of 8 percent. Such is the power of compound interest. Of course, no country can maintain a gain of 8 percent per year over a century, what with linked constraints, accidental reverses, cyclical downers, changes in government, competition, and the soothing corruption of success. Even Japan has had its setbacks in real estate and banking; while the increase in the exchange value of the yen chilled demand for Japanese manufactures. In contrast British industry, buoyed by North Sea oil, hospitality to foreign enterprise, and Margaret Thatcher's showdown with tool-dragging labor chiefs, has done better since the 1980s

International comparisons are arbitrary and often contradictory, so that it was not clear whether, around 1990, the United States was in first or third place in income per head, whether its lower rate of productivity increase would persist, whether these other, faster-growing economies, plus several newcomers, were converging with it or on the way to passing it.* These issues were further embroiled by the conjuncture of the early 1990s: the Japanese found themselves in the throes of a slowdown, while the American economy continued to grow. Perhaps the Japanese had come to the end of their "miracle."1 Not to worry. The American data recall the earlier retreats of the Netherlands and Great Britain: loss of market share in manufactures; wastage of entire branches; new hires in service jobs, usually poorerpaid; polarization of incomes.4 7 On the other hand, U.S. unemployment remains low (lower than European, but not Japanese), and continued American dominance in new lines, among them the hightech, computer-linked manufactures (software and hard), gives reason for confidence (hope?). A new report argues that, while Americans save less (15 percent of income as against 33 percent in Japan), they put their savings to better use; capital productivity in Germany and Japan is reckoned to be only two thirds the American level

Japan is excellent, overall productivity is substantially lower (55 percent of the American), because agriculture is cosseted and the service sector is overmanned, highly fragmented, and uncompetitive. The whole system is designed to create and preserve vested interests, and so much the worse for the consumer. Meanwhile the yen is overvalued, and international comparisons based on exchange rates tilt grotesquely in Japan's favor. The reality is very different. Japanese housing is so fragile and space so scarce that it is often easier to tear down a house and rebuild than to look for better accommodation. Unless, of course, one is ready to go out into the endless suburbs and do a daily calvary to and from work

The invention of the automobile should have boosted British industry. N o country had a longer tradition of machine manufacture and engineering; none so large a pool of skilled metal workers. The potential demand was good. British income levels topped all of Europe, and imperial dominions and possessions offered sheltered markets overseas. Yet Britain was slow on the pickup and saw first France and then the United States take the lead. In 1913, only one British car stood amongst the top ten of American and British producers—the Maxwell, in sixth place with 17,000 units, against 202,667 by Ford.4 9 Given the winding, narrow roads, British car makers might have concentrated on small vehicles. Some of them did; but early on, the industry moved to large, pricey models that appealed to richer buyers (many with drivers) and brought larger unit profits

When, after World War II, foreign cars invaded the British market, employers blamed labor for want of diligence and attention, and labor blamed the bosses for want of competence and attention. Both were right.5 2 On a scale of labor efficiency, the British system was at the low end, the American and German considerably better, the Japanese just about the best. Piecework wages and bonuses in a world of rapid innovation and sharp competition invited conflict. Every change in work and pace was pretext for disagreement; every settiement a source of disappointment; every gain a sacred and vested right; every loss something to be made up; and no one forgot anything. The strike statistics are not dismaying, but they omit the run-of-the-mill, wildcat interruptions, the explosions of anger, the fury between supervisors and labor stewards. All of this sent the British auto industry into terminal decline. Car registrations went from 2.5 million in 1951 to over 9.5 in 1966 to over 15 million in 1980, but the big winners were the foreign makers, once they got their postwar act together: 5 percent of the British market in 1965, 14 in 1970, 49 in 1978, 58 percent in 1982.5 3 The multinationals with branches in Britain—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—did litde to exploit the export possibilities of their British subsidiaries; they had easier platforms to work with.5 4 On the contrary, thanks to the Common Market, they were able to import parts into Britain. From 1973 to 1983—ten years—local content in G M cars made in Britain fell from 98 to 22 percent; in Fords, from 88 to 22. Expressed in car equivalents, this represented an import of 150,000 vehicles

Had it not been for foreign transplants, including some Japanese factories using Britain as a springboard to the European Common Market, the British auto manufacture was headed for extinction. As it was, it now depended "on the financial resources, design and production technology, managerial methods, working practices and approaches to industrial relations" of American, French, and especially Japanese multinationals.5 7 The explanation for this sad calvary is, as always, multiple. Here is Sidney Pollard: "[In addition to government policy], other factors in the decline have been poor management, complacency, poor industrial relations, an over-fragmented industrial structure, unhelpful financial institutions and a relatively stagnant home market."5 8 And the first of all was poor management—another way of saying poor entrepreneurship

Perfidious Albion as superpower. To this day, and in spite of two world wars, the average Frenchman thinks of Britain as his country's chief rival and adversary in Europe. One does not forget Agincourt and Joan of Arc that quickly. These animadversions, of course, were unconscious salutes to English success. The French, as we have seen, were particularly vexed to watch the British pull ahead. They viewed economic growth and the accumulation of wealth as the keys to political power, and they correcdy associated the succession of British victories in European and overseas combat with the resources the British could mobilize: the numerous ships (over a hundred thousand of theirs, only twenty thousand of ours), the countiess seamen. Some French even imagined that England was an island without an interior, all coasts and harbors, a land without cultivators, composed entirely of sailors and city dwellers. Others, like Boisguillebert, were overawed by British wealth, the revenues of the crown, the ability to borrow both at home and abroad

(To this day, the French like to think and pretend to others that they do not care for money. They are not alone: idealism is the affectation of those who feel they have less than they deserve in the presence of those who have more. In the eighteenth century, Continental observers saw the English as great materialists. A hundred years later, the Americans became the new target of obloquy, the British now joining their erstwhile critics in scorning these nouveaux riches.) In short, you couldn't trust these Brits.8 Some French took comfort in antique precedent: Britain was the "modern Carthage"; France, the heir of Rome. In the last analysis, an island-nation of rootiess traders (shopkeepers) could not hold its own with a solid, terra firma kingdom. Another big mistake. In the European world of competition for power and wealth, then, Britain became the principal target of emulation from the beginning of the eighteenth century. Other countries sent emissaries and spies to learn what they could of British techniques. Merchants and industrialists visited the island to see what they could. Governments did their best to stimulate enterprise by the usual array of incentives: subsidies, monopoly privileges, exemptions from taxes, assignment of labor, bribes. Such efforts had mixed results, pardy because these very encouragements, by their partiality, prevented or retarded the diffusion of techniques; but even more because the follower countries were not yet ready to learn and adopt the new mode of production

intervals of peace, partial or general, permitted British expats and Continental competitors to get on with the task—to introduce machine spinning, for example, in the southern Netherlands (Ghent and Verviers) and northern France.

Every country has its own resources and capabilities, and if it permits reason and the market to rule, its economic development will follow those paths that make the most of its means. Thus a country rich in coal will engage in fuelintensive branches of industry and adopt techniques that a coalless country would eschew. A country short of coal but rich in running streams will rely, when possible, on waterpower rather than steam engines.

So we have no uniformity of sequence, no single way, no law of development. Each of the would-be industrializers, the so-called follower countries, however much influenced by the British experience—to some extent inspired, to some extent frightened or appalled—developed its own path to modernity. And if this was true of the early industrializers, how much more is it true today. Everything depends on timing. The content of modern technology is ever-changing and the task and means of emulation change with it. Developing countries today will necessarily skip stages and processes that occupied the British for decades: why should they repeat what they don't have

In the Middle Ages, most peasants had been reduced (or raised, for slaves) to a condition of bondage or serfdom. Typically the peasant was tied to the soil, not free to leave without the consent of his lord. Serfdom sometimes also implied a personal, "bodily" tie of serf to master, so that the lord could move the peasant about, and the peasant, even leaving with permission, continued to owe dues. In western Europe during the high and late Middle Ages, these bonds relaxed, pardy because the monetization of the economy and the growing appetite for exotic goods led landlords to commute labor services into money rents, even more because the rise of cities provided points of exit from the seignorial system. By 1500, England, France, the Low Countries, and western Germany had few serfs in the old sense.

The lands west of the Rhine were absorbed for a moment (until 1815) into Revolutionary France, and came and stayed under the new emancipatory dispensation. East of the Rhine, however, the French came and went. They left a memory of foreign oppression that served as justification for the later reimposition of servile obligations. Even so, war and the pursuit of power had their own surprising logic. The most important German political unit east of the Rhine was the kingdom of Prussia, a modern Sparta, an overmilitarized kingdom not given to romantic ideals. Yet Prussia emancipated the serfs in 1809—not because of enlightened attitudes, but rather because it had suffered grievous defeats at the hands of the French army and recognized that serfs will not fight so hard and well as free men. In other German states, the taste of freedom had created an instant addiction; reactionaries found litde support. The solution, which tried to please everybody, was to free the peasants and buy the landowners off; nothing like cash in the hand to overcome scruples and regrets. Where to find the money? The landowners were generally indemnified by state bonds, which the state then amortized by levies on the peasants over a period of years. (The one issue where reaction was acceptable, even popular, was the status of Jews. There disabilities were restored, and decades were to pass before full emancipation was grudgingly conceded. Even then, public gains were spoiled by private hatred.) The other great barrier to mobility in German lands was the division of society into status groups (Stdnde) of reserved vocation and privilege. The lords had their land, ruled over their serfs and tenants, administered low if not high justice, led soldiers into battie. Merchants held a monopoly of trade but were not permitted to own rural land. The industrial crafts were reserved to properly trained journeymen and masters in the cities and towns. The countryside was peasant and seigneurial turf. The relationship of all this to medieval concepts of the three orders (lords, peasants, clergy), now with urban traders and artisans thrown in, will not have escaped the reader.* * O n e finds similar social s c h é m a s in India: b r a h m i n s , w a r r i o r s, m e r c h a n t s , p e a s a n t s ; a n d in T o k u g a w a J a p a n : samurai, p e a s a n t s , m e r c h a n t s .

Farther east, in Poland and Russia, the old ways held on longer, indeed were reinforced by the logic of commercial agriculture and comparative advantage. From the sixteenth century, the open plains of East Elbean Europe became a granary and livestock breeder for the urban centers of the west. The resulting exports (cereals, hides, tallow) stimulated land settlement; with one major hitch: scarcity of labor. Land was far more abundant than people. Over a hundred years ago, Russian agrarian scholars pointed out that such disparity was incompatible with large holdings; or as one theoretical economist, picking up on this tradition, put it, three things cannot coexist: free land, free labor, and large estates. Why should peasants sign or stay on as hired labor when they can go off to the frontier and farm their own land?1 3 This meant that lords in Russia who wanted to cultivate on a large scale had to fix their workers to the soil. Hence the phenomenon known as the second serfdom—a progressive reinforcement of the peasant's obligations, reducing him to near-slave status. This policy can be tracked through a succession of decrees, each stronger than the one before, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. These deepened the social and political gulf between West and East—the one moving steadily toward greater freedom, the other to petrified servitude. Russia became in effect a huge prison, and with the exception of some months in 1917 and the few years since 1990, it has remained a prison ever since. (It remains to be seen whether the current experiment in democracy will last.

In general, whenever industry located in empty places, usually to minimize transport costs (also in connection with canal and road projects), the only solution was to move in forced labor. This was Russia's school for wastage, an anticipation of the gulag. Even in more densely setded areas, where casual layabouts and "street people" could be had for food and booze to do loading, unloading, carting and hauling, steady work called for servile labor assigned to the job. Entire villages, often belonging to the state, were moved about in this way. In the long run, of course, the system failed. Unfree labor would not work well or honestiy. In the words of a report on the Tula Armory in 1861: "It would seem to be generally indisputable that only free men are capable of honest work. He who from childhood has been forced to work is incapable of assuming responsibility as long as his social condition remains unchanged."1 4 This, more than scale of production, explains the giantism of some of these early enterprises: they needed lots of people because productivity was so low. A better solution was eventually found in the institution of obrok, personal dues paid by serfs detached from the estate to earn a living elsewhere.* This arrangement allowed the serf to keep what he made above the obrok, hence encouraged initiative and diligence. Some even became entrepreneurs, and the best of these could become quite wealthy—thus the Elisseeffs, owners of St. Petersburg's most luxurious delicatessen, later reduced to "Gastronom No. 1" after confiscation by the Soviets. One of the descendants fled to the United States, became professor of Japanese language and literature at Harvard. Many of these successful serfs paid fortunes to buy their freedom and that of their family, although cunning estate owners often held one or two children back, just in case the serf became even richer

Guilds were to be found all over the world—in Europe, but also in Islamic lands, India, China, and Japan. The economic objectives were to control entry, typically via obligatory apprenticeship and limitations on mastership; to uphold quality standards (no amateurs or "botchers" (bunglers) allowed); and to restrict competition both within (limitations on size of workshop and numbers employed) and without (prohibition of nonguild manufacture within the jurisdiction and exclusion of all imports from outside

The Ministry of Commerce put it blundy: " . . . for Austrian industry, which since the fall of the prohibitive system has to struggle in all directions against foreign competition, the grant of complete freedom of movement is no longer a question of mere improvement and greater well-being, but a necessary condition of its ability to compete."1 7 If the government still had doubts about the matter, the military defeats in northern Italy drove home the need for reform. War, especially unsuccessful war, concentrates the mind. On 20 December 1859 an imperial patent established freedom of enterprise throughout the Habsburg dominions. The move was contagious. The system of corporate industrial control began collapsing throughout the Germanies. By 1870 and unification, the batde was over

Most of the road and river tolls went back to times of political weakness and general insecurity when higher political authority could not prevent robber barons and local jurisdictions from levying on passersby. Once there, only try to remove: the one thing everyone respected was vested interest, because everyone had one, or wanted to have one. Even where higher authority ruled and permission was needed to levy, the right to charge was seen, not as a fee for service or facilities, but as one more source of income, hence a mark of favor to be solicited or bought

Needless to say, the local barons and municipal authorities who enjoyed these gains had no desire to give them up by way of easing trade and encouraging business; on the contrary, growing trade was an incentive to increase the tariffs. Such increases invariably drew howls of protest and pain, but no one was ready to crack down even on small gougers; too many glass houses to start throwing stones. The initial result of industrial development, then, was to raise the barriers. From the seventeenth century on, the centralizing tendency of European monarchies worked against this racket. One of the primary goals of the new bureaucracies was to erase these levies and interferences, seen not only as restraints of trade, hence tax-eaters, but also as poaching, as lèse-majesté. The British had litde to do along these lines: their local tolls had largely disappeared by the fifteenth century; as a result they had the largest national market in Europe. The French needed much more, and the great minister Colbert issued order upon order banning and abolishing this legacy of disorder; to litde avail. Once again, it was the revolution that did the job, one hundred years later, clearing the debris of an outworn regime

The tenacity of the enemies of other people's trade fairly beggars the imagination. Take the river Scheldt. It rises in northern France and flows through one of the most prosperous industrial regions in the world on its way past Tournai, Ghent, and Antwerp to the sea. Some distance below Antwerp, by the accidents of history, the mouth of the river passes into Holland, which by the Treaty of Munster in 1648 obtained the right to close it to navigation. This Holland did, for over two hundred years, for the aim was to kill Antwerp as seaport in favor of Rotterdam—no small matter. For fifteen years, however, from 1815 to 1830, Antwerp and Rotterdam were both part of the Netherlands, so in theory, these rights should have lapsed. Not at all: in 1830, when Belgium seceded, Holland reaffirmed its right and got the other interested powers to accept this levy on international trade. Not until 1863 could Belgium, after long negotiations, buy in this outrageous toll, with each of the powers interested in the trade paying its quota

It was the automobile that did the job: as the number of vehicles increased, it became impossible to halt them at city boundaries for inspection of contents; or to compel Paris autos, for example, to submit as in the 1920s to a dipstick measurement of the fuel in the gas tank upon leaving and returning. Even so, as late as the 1960s, road signs advised drivers entering Florence from the surrounding countryside to declare such commodities as wine and cigarettes.

Russia was a different story. Transport was difficult, to begin with, and tolls were not a problem. Nature was. On land, it was easier to move goods in winter than in summer. Snow and ice were smooth; the roads were not. Water was better for bulky commodities (grain, timber). But Russian rivers run north-south, and most traffic moved eastwest. Here cold was the enemy: in the south, waterways remained open nine months of the year; in the north, only six weeks. Miss the cut-off, and goods would perish; machines, rust; idleness, turn into oblivion

The significance of institutional and cultural impediments to development shows well in the contrasting experience of Europe's periphery— the lands around the edge, outside the core of industrialization in western and central Europe; and, within this periphery, between those countries and regions that learned to catch up and those that still lag. Start in the north. Scandinavia, desperately poor in the eighteenth century yet intellectually and politically rich, was late in learning the ways of modern industry, but, once started, quick to pick them up. The implications for wages and income show in the statistical estimates (see Table 16.2). This impressive performance owes everything to cultural preparation. The Scandinavian countries, equal partners in Europe's intellectual and scientific community, enjoyed high levels of literacy and offered a first-class education at higher levels.2 1 They also operated in an atmosphere of political stability and public order. Once among the most warlike populations in Europe—one thinks of the Viking raiders of the Middle Ages or of the imperial ambitions of seventeenth-century Sweden—now they were the most peaceable, even stolid by comparison with peoples to the south. Property rights were secure; the peasantry was largely free; and life was a long stretch of somber hard work broken intermittently by huge bouts of drinking and seasonal sunshine

Scandinavia built on free enterprise and quick response, on the export of staples to more advanced industrial countries, on the investment of these gains in more diversified production. The big export commodities were timber, copper, later on, iron ore; for Denmark, agricultural products. In all cases, development proceeded by moving from the raw to the processed—from logs to boards, and then to pulp; from iron ore to pig iron to wrought iron; from raw fish to canned and jarred; from milk to cream, butter, and cheese. Much of this was fostered by improvements in transportation and banking institutions, and here the state and foreign capital played a role. But very early on, Scandinavia was exporting know-how in the form of its own émigrés, toward tsarist Russia for example, where Alfred Nobel was one of the pioneers of the infant petroleum industry. The Russian state had been pushing industrial development on and off for hundreds of years, huffing and puffing and squeezing the population as it went; the Scandinavians eased into the process and glided away

Compare the late industrial development of Mediterranean Europe, in particular of Italy, Spain, and Portugal. All of these were hurt by religious and intellectual intolerance, and all were plagued by political instability. Spain, though nominally united, was divided as before by regional autonomies, and the weakness of central authority invited foreign intrusion and dynastic pretensions, with intermittent revolution and civil war. Portugal, better knit, was politically much the same, with the exception that the monarchy could flee to Brazil and wait for better times. Italy remained fragmented, with Lombardy still in Habsburg (Austrian) hands as late as 1860 and Venetia to 1866; the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples and the south) under Bourbon rule until 1861; the papal states and Rome under clerical government until 1870

the contrast between Mediterranean and northern Europe is undeniably large. Around 1900, for example, when only 3 percent of the population of Great Britain was illiterate, the figure for Italy was 48 percent, for Spain 56 percent, for Portugal 78 percent.2 4 The religious persecutions of old—the massacres, hunts, expulsions, forced conversions, and self-imposed intellectual closure—proved to be a kind of original sin.

All these countries were poor, handicapped by meager, highly variable rainfall that reduced agricultural yields far below those of wellwatered northern Europe. Spain was the least favored. A notional line between wet northern Europe and dry southern (above and below 750 mm. [30 in.] of rain a year) divides Portugal and Italy approximately in half; but 90 percent of Spain lies on the dry side, and much of the wetter land above the line is mountainous and not arable. Add in Spain's high average altitude and hence extremes of temperature, and we have a bad country for cereals.

Eastern Europe was like another world. In Slavic lands—Russia particularly—serfdom persisted in its worst form.

Nor did Russian enterprises operate in the same world as those of western Europe. They sold to the national market, exported little or nothing.

Poorer and more backward than Russia were the Balkan lands, most of them suffering under the inefficient Ottoman yoke, the tyranny of a society more primitive than theirs. Long quiescent, they caught the nationalist virus in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and got tangled in an endless struggle for freedom, first with the Turks and then with other Balkan nationalities. This could be a noble cause, but because identity rested on uncompromising religion, it easily conduced to hatred and unreason. Not good for business or development. These were societies that did not generate enterprise from within. Trade and money were for Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Germans. These outsiders were not popular—not only because they got rich by buying and selling (so, not by hard work) and did so at the expense of peasants and landowners, but also because they were different in manners, dress, appearance, religion. (The outsiders returned the scorn, in spades.) When independence and modern politics came to the Balkans, the natives did their best to drive out the strangers, that is, to expel the most active elements in the economy. And they succeeded, in the face of the outsiders' natural reluctance to leave. (These inhospitable and hostile places offered so many chances to make money.) The Balkans remain poor today. In the absence of metics, they war on one another and blame their misery on exploitation by richer economies in western Europe. It feels better that way.

During the first half of the nineteenth century, the standard Russian infantry weapon was a smoothbore, muzzle-loading, flindock musket rather like the weapons used in the previous century. (Daniel Boone, with his Kentucky long rifle, had better.) The 1828 Russian model, like those before, used round balls and was not accurate beyond 200 yards. The breechloaders used in West European armies were not deemed suitable—too complicated and not sturdy enough for field combat. Also too difficult for Russian armory production techniques. Russia's army as a whole was reconciled to this backwardness. For one thing, procurement was a regimental matter, and officers preferred to spend their money on food and drink. (Drink, more than combat, was the favorite test of an officer's manliness.) "Regiments tried to pay as litde as possible for weapons, and the regimental suppliers regarded periodic trips to grimy government arsenals and to distant small arms factories as punishment."2 6 The arms makers in turn gave the buyers what they were looking for—so and so many pieces, good, bad, and indifferent. The government tried to prevent shoddiness by assigning inspectors to examine the arms. To litde avail; the inspectors were part of the system and were not going to bite the hands that fed them. (A similar attitude toward production would flourish under various Soviet five-year plans. Fulfill the plan, turn out the units, pay the inspectors, and devil take the quality.

) The result was bad screws and rivets, misfit barrels, rotten stocks, mismatched lock parts. In 1853, just before fighting began in the Crimea, the tsarist army had only half the muskets that were authorized. And as bad as the arms were, the Russian soldier made them worse.

soldier had to pay out of pocket for grease; so, little or no grease. Bullets were costiy—they were not the sort of thing that Russia could produce in large quantities—so clay bullets were used for target practice and damaged the barrels. Even officers took little care of their sidearms, to the point where the Ministry of War advised issuing pistols rather than revolvers. Regimental gunsmiths lacked training and proper equipment and had to shoe horses, fix wheels, and repair guns with the same chisels, hammers, and saws. Rules follow practice. Confronted with these shortcomings, Russian military strategists systematically underestimated the value of firepower. Bodies were seen as more important than arms—bodies and "moral force"—and the bayonet was preferred to guns. "The bullet is a fool," opined Marshal Suvarov, "but the bayonet is a fine lad."* The bayonet was surer, and reliance on guns could only weaken resolve and fighting spirit. It would be a mistake, therefore, to change from muzzleloaders to breechloaders. The soldier would only waste a lot of ammunition and forget how to charge. As firepower in other armies shot up, the Russian soldier was being schooled in thrift. The regimental economy mirrored the larger society: dragged down by inefficiency; wasting time and labor in accessory activities (agriculture, gathering wood and hay, construction, haulage); afraid of change.t The Crimean War (1854-56) was a disaster. The Russians lost what they could afford to lose most—people, six hundred thousand of them. The trivial losses in territory hurt the generals and the tsar more. Some Russians were still using muzzle-loading flintlocks, while the British and French picked them off with percussion rifles that had three and five times the range

One knows how the "first industrial nation" did it. Slow and easy. Britain trained a factory labor force and accumulated capital as it went. In those early days, machines were typically small and cheap. Scale was small. Older buildings could be converted to industrial use. In short, threshold requirements were modest. So British enterprise could grow by plowing back earnings, by pooling personal resources, by borrowing from relatives, by renting facilities. Financial intermediaries, except for such loan brokers as attorney/solicitors, played a very small role. Banks confined themselves to supplying short-term or demand loans to facilitate real transactions. Some of this took the form of lines of credit, renewed as paid down. In good times, such lines were the equivalent of medium- or even long-term credit. In good times. In bad, they could be called in, or maturities could be shortened. With the passing years, all of this changed: machines got bigger and heavier, required buildings to their measure. Scale economies and throughput grew as transport facilities improved. Still, British enterprise was rich enough to finance these outlays from within; if internal funds fell short, one typically brought in additional partners

Britain had to find special ways to pay for public and quasi-public undertakings like docks, canals, and railways. Because the Bubble Act of 1720, passed in the wake of the notorious South Sea speculation and crash, prevented the creation of a joint stock with freely transferable shares, big projects typically went to large partnerships with assets vested in trustees. Not a happy solution in a commercial world of unlimited liability "to the last shilling and acre

In the nineteenth century, when things got cosdier and risks greater, the most effective device for mobilizing capital was the chartered jointstock company with limited liability—chartered because limited liability could be conferred only by the crown or Parliament. These large, semipublic enterprises never made much use of long-term bank financing, because no bank was big enough. The charter of the Bank of England provided that no other bank could have more than six partners. Not until 1826, and then only outside a sixty-five-mile radius from London, were joint-stock banks permitted; and only in 1833 were non-note-issuing joint-stock banks permitted inside that radius. Yet these new banks were litde different in size and policy from their private counterparts, and even the railway builders didn't need their help

By the time Europe's first follower countries got going (post-1815), Britain had known two human generations of growth and industrial development. That delay was in part an accident of political history, which has a nasty way of interfering with the bestlaid plans. Twenty-five years of revolution and war from 1789 to 1815 diverted Continental resources from building to destruction, played havoc with enterprise and trade, generated some invention but delayed much application, inspired projects but then inhibited them—in effect, delayed industrial emulation of Britain an extra generation

By that time, the task of catching up was bigger, but the potential gain as well. For this reason, some have argued that it pays to be late: you can skip the mistakes, begin with the latest techniques and equipment. * On the other hand, the time lost lagging also costs. It pays to get started as soon as possible. So the Continental follower countries felt that they had neither means nor time to grow as Britain had. They were competing in the same arena. Why wait fifty years to catch up with 1815? They needed more capital than Britain had needed, and they wanted it now. They wanted up-to-date factories, machines, engines. From about 1830 on, they wanted railways, canals, roads, and bridges. Where would they get the money? Four places: (1) personal investment; (2) financial intermediaries and private credit; (3) government assistance; (4) international capital flows. First, the Continent had its share of rich people. Unfortunately, most of these were landowners who scorned the ungenteel activities of trade and industry. Indeed, many of them had a distaste even for agriculture (they preferred to feel the earth through horses' hoofs) and hired stewards to manage their estates. The owners lived on rents and produce; sometimes on capital. The stewards got rich. Yet some gentry and aristocrats did gravitate to industry, partly because they hoped to make money, pardy because industry was a logical by-product of estate management and regalian rights. Their land held valuable mineral resources or forests that could provide timber for ships, buildings, or pit props in mines. In central and eastern Europe, their control over a resident serf population provided them with a ready-made factory (or protofactory) labor force. Some of these noblemen actually became industrialists and merchants themselves. One thinks of such families as the Desandrouin and the Arenberg in the Hainaut (in later Belgium), the Furstenberg and Schwarzenberg in Austria, the Wendel in Lorraine (become French in 1766)

In theory, noble married noble. But what if a commoner was very rich? Well, then, noble might marry commoner; the higher the noble rank, the more comfortable the misalliance. (Petty noble families had to be careful about that kind of thing.) Luck helped, as when a prince Schwarzenberg (good name), aged thirty-one, married the eighty-two-year-old sole heiress to a merchant fortune. The lady obligingly died soon after, but then the young prince died too—"without descendants," of course. So the estate fell to the main branch of the Schwarzenberg clan, which went on to prove its spirit of enterprise, not only by its choice of marriage partners but by setting up industrial ventures, reclaiming land, founding an investment bank

After centuries of more or less profitable activity, a network of private banks was in place (personal firms or partnerships), collectively rich and capable of financing medium- and long-term investments in industry and choosing customers not so much by price and terms as by probity, resourcefulness, above all connections. These groups typically hung on religious and cultural affinities: the Huguenot-Calvinist, Sephardic-Jewish, German-Jewish, Greek-Orthodox commercial "families" knew their own kind—whom to trust and whom to worry about, whom to ask and whom to work with.

lines of credit, extended in support of real commercial transactions and covered by discountable commercial paper. But we also have examples of direct long-term funding and participation in company formation: thus the Paris Rothschilds financed French railways and French and Belgian coal mines and forges; the Vienna branch of the bank promoted railways and invested in ironworks and coal mines in Habsburg territory; and the Banque Seillière in Paris joined the merchant house of Boigues to relaunch the ironworks at Le Creusot in 1836.3 One should not underestimate the resourcefulness of these old trading houses. They could fairly smell profit and had built their fortunes on opportunism and variety. To this we should add a flair for profitable marital alliances, which could provide both funds and business contacts.

Much depended on the robustness and loyalty of one's creditor, but even the most trusting and determined lender could find his hand forced as other banks began calling in their loans. That is the trouble with a network system: when it is strong, it is stronger than the sum of the parts; but when it weakens, the weakness spreads easily from one link to the next.

This collective danger, and the need for long-term investment, led to the invention of a new financial intermediary, the joint-stock investment bank, or as the French came to call it, the crédit mobilier. The first inspiration for such institutions came from bureaucrats as well as business interests: even before 1820, officials and merchants in Bavaria were calling for a special bank to promote industry. The earliest working examples were quasipublic institutions—the Société Générale in Brussels and the Seehandlung in Berlin. The new form gained considerably in importance with the coming of the railway—a capital-eater if ever there was one, both in itself and for the large-scale industrial enterprises it encouraged. So it was that in the 1830s the Société Générale, until then a quiet commercial bank, turned into a development bank; and that France spawned a gaggle of caisses—joint-stock limited partnerships (commandites par actions) created to finance industry at medium and long term

In Germany and farther east, the development bank came into its own, founding and financing industry, supervising performance, promoting innovation. These new institutions combined investment, commercial, and deposit banking (hence the appelation "universal banks"). The best of them gathered technical intelligence and served as consulting bureaus. Such a mix of functions struck British bankers as a violation of sacred writ. How could one safely combine short-term, even demand, liabilities with long-term immobilization of funds? Surely a recipe for disaster. The answer lay, first, in the rapid growth of the German economy from the 1830s on—the kind of thing that makes everyone look good; and second, in the preference of these banks for "well-heeled" customers. (The two essentials of successful banking are, first, other people's money, and second, lending to the rich.)7 The ability of these universal banks to find well-heeled customers and offset risks became legendary. The best and biggest were the famous D-Banken (so-called because their names all began with the same letter): the Darmstadter Bank, Discontogesellschaft, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank. Two of these (Darmstadter and Dresdner) started in provincial centers and moved to Berlin

Between 1870 and 1913, book value of assets of these mixed banks rose from about 600 million to over 17.5 billion marks—from 6 to over 20 percent of the stock of industrial capital.8 Most of the shares were in heavy industry. Smaller enterprises found help elsewhere; the business of big banks was big business.

The French state sought private enterprise to build the railroads and refused to purchase shares. On the other hand, it agreed to pay for the land and roadbed (including tunnels and bridges), justifying this substantial aid—about 18 percent of total cost as of early 1848—on the ground that the road was going to come back to the state anyway at the end of the concession period. All in all, and counting a few state loans, the French government paid slighdy over 25 percent of the cost of railway lines to that date

In Russia, the state assisted banking and industry, and the railroads were state-built, owned, and operated. Commerce and topography be damned. The emblematic example: the construction of the first important line, from Moscow to St. Petersburg. The tsar was asked to select the route. He took a ruler and drew a straight line between the two cities. But the tip of one finger stuck out, so the line was built with one curved section. Direct subsidies and aids are only part of the story

in Britain, government supported and protected overseas trade: the country as a whole paid the associated security costs of private venturers and adventurers in distant seas. Such indirect subsidy, easy to overlook, was crucial. In Britain again, as elsewhere, industrial promotion also took the form of defense against outside competition. The later record of British commitment to free trade (more or less mid-nineteenth century to 1930) has tended to obscure the earlier and much longer practice of economic nationalism, whether by tariff protection or discriminatory shipping rules (navigation acts

In France, the old monarchy assisted new industries and technologies—by subsidy and stipend, fiscal exemption and privilege, or socalled loans that remained unpaid. Because of these helps, ambitious businessmen had reason to court people of influence, and the court, like an overripe cheese, invited corruption. The only real constraint was the increasing penury of the French treasury; by the 1780s, the money had run out. Meanwhile, as in England, enterprise found a silent ally in tariff protection, against the world without and other parts of the kingdom within. (Commercial barriers reflected France's history of piecemeal territorial accretion.) This long-standing policy stood inviolate until 1786, when a bureaucrats' treaty traded easier access for French wines and silks to Britain for admission of British cottons, woolens, and iron into France.* Such an opening would have had drastic consequences for French industry, unprepared as yet for the new machine technologies. But revolution in 1789 and war with Britain in 1792 put an end to the experiment

A general suspicion of overuse of the arguments is aroused by the demonstration that they are invoked time and again almost routinely to cover a wide variety of real situations. The suspicion is heightened when it can be shown, as I have attempted to do in the preceding pages, that the arguments have considerable intrinsic appeal because they hitch onto powerful myths (Hubris-Nemesis, Divine Providence, Oedipus) and influential interpretive formulas (ceci tuera cela, zero-sum) or because they cast a flattering light on their authors and provide a boost for their egos. In view of these extraneous attractions, it becomes likely that the standard reactionary theses will often be embraced regardless of their fit.

There remains then a long and difficult road to be traveled from the traditional internecine, intransigent discourse to a more “democracy-friendly” kind of dialogue. For those wishing to undertake this expedition there should be value in knowing about a few danger signals, such as arguments that are in effect contraptions specifically designed to make dialogue and deliberation impossible.

the gulf that separates such a state from democratic-pluralistic regimes as they emerge historically from strife and civil war is uncomfortably and perilously wide. A people that only yesterday was engaged in fratricidal struggles is not likely to settle down overnight to those constructive give-and-take deliberations. Far more likely, there will initially be agreement to disagree, but without any attempt at melding the opposing points of view—that is indeed the nature of religious tolerance. Or, if there is discussion, it will be a typical “dialogue of the deaf”—a dialogue that will in fact long function as a prolongation of, and a substitute for, civil war. Even in the most “advanced” democracies, many debates are, to paraphrase Clausewitz, a “continuation of civil war with other means.” Such debates, with each party on the lookout for arguments that kill, are only too familiar from democratic politics as usual.

Modern pluralistic regimes have typically come into being, it is increasingly recognized, not because of some preexisting wide consensus on “basic values,” but rather because various groups that had been at each other’s throats for a prolonged period had to recognize their mutual inability to achieve dominance. Tolerance and acceptance of pluralism resulted eventually from a standoff between bitterly hostile opposing groups.2

Curiously, the very stability and proper functioning of a well-ordered democratic society depend on its citizens arraying themselves in a few major (ideally two) clearly defined groups holding different opinions on basic policy issues. It can easily happen then that these groups become walled off from each other—in this sense democracy continuously generates its own walls. As the process feeds on itself, each group will at some point ask about the other, in utter puzzlement and often with mutual revulsion, “How did they get to be that way?” In the mid-eighties, when this study was begun,

The backlash so far experienced by the Welfare State may in fact be rather mild in comparison with the earlier onslaughts and conflicts that followed upon the assertion of individual freedoms in the eighteenth century or upon the broadening of political participation in the nineteenth. Once we contemplate this protracted and perilous seesawing of action and reaction, we come to appreciate more than ever the profound wisdom of Whitehead’s well-known observation, “The major advances in civilization are processes which all but wreck the societies in which they occur.”3

a famous 1949 lecture by the English sociologist T. H. Marshall on the “development of citizenship” in the West.2 Marshall had distinguished between the civil, political, and social dimensions of citizenship and then had proceeded to explain, very much in the spirit of the Whig interpretation of history, how the more enlightened human societies had successfully tackled one of these dimensions after the other. According to Marshall’s scheme, which conveniently allocated about a century to each of the three tasks, the eighteenth century witnessed the major battles for the institution of civil citizenship—from freedom of speech, thought, and religion to the right to even-handed justice and other aspects of individual freedom or, roughly, the “Rights of Men” of the natural law doctrine and of the American and French Revolutions. In the course of the nineteenth century, it was the political aspect of citizenship, that is, the right of citizens to participate in the exercise of political power, that made major strides as the right to vote was extended to ever-larger groups. Finally, the rise of the Welfare State in the twentieth century extended the concept of citizenship to the social and economic sphere, by recognizing that minimal conditions of education, health, economic well-being, and security are basic to the life of a civilized being as well as to meaningful exercise of the civil and political attributes of citizenship.

In 2020, Matthew Klein and Michael Pettis wrote an important book that asked a disarmingly simple question: “Are trade wars class wars?” Their answer was yes. They note that the winners in trade wars—the exporting countries—are actually losers in that keeping their costs down in order to keep their exports and exchange rate competitive lowers their own workers’ wages. Meanwhile, the true cost to the importing countries lies in hollowing out their economies as imports replace their domestic industries. So, who wins if both sides lose? The owners of firms on both sides and no one else.

when we encountered Volcker’s hammer in chapter 2, interest rates are the ever-ready tool that central banks use to tame inflation. But as we also noted in chapter 2, that comes at a considerable cost to the economy involved and causes a lot of collateral damage. In chapter 5, we noted how central banks basically have only two tools. Interest rates are one of them. Buying and selling financial assets to regulate the amount of liquidity in the economy is the other, with various programs of quantitative easing and the like. That’s not much.

“The difference between inflation and unemployment is that inflation affects just everybody. . . . Inflation has a social-wide kind of impact.” But is that true? Consumers are the first obvious victim when prices start rising, and we are all consumers. But not all consumers are the same. Logically, poorer consumers are going to suffer more. This is because of the income effect of inflation that affects how they spend their money when prices go up.

people with low incomes spend a greater share of their earnings on rent, food, and other basic consumption goods. As inflation erodes the real value of their income, they can purchase less than before with the same money, which will lower their living standard. In other words, when prices go up, everyone tightens their belt, but the poorer have to tighten their belts much more than the rich, while their pants have much less to give in the first place. This claim, however, needs to be qualified with another important distributional consequence of inflation, that inflation favors debtors and punishes creditors. This mechanism is known as the Fisher effect, after the economist Irving Fisher.

attempts to safeguard the real value of money may “benefit us all,” but they disproportionately benefit the creditor class for the simple reason that they have much more to lose and much more at risk. The rich have wealth. That is, they have assets that generate income. The poor can and will shift their consumption down to preserve the purchasing power of their income. The rich instead want compensation for their wealth losses, which is what they get through higher rates.

That compensation of the rich does not just happen through higher rates, it also happens through who gets to share in those excess profits. University of Massachusetts researchers recently estimated that the United States generated $301 billion in fossil fuel profits in 2022. Analyzing the U.S. distribution of those profits revealed that 51 percent of those profits went to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, predominantly through direct shareholdings and private company ownership. In contrast the bottom 50 percent only received 1 percent. As the researchers put it, “The incremental fossil-fuel profits in 2022 over those in 2021 were enough to increase the disposable income of the wealthiest Americans by 6 percent and compensate all their purchasing power loss from inflation that year, thereby exacerbating inflation inequality.”

But consumption rather obviously varies across a more complex range of dimensions than veganism, including age, gender, years of education, etc. In reality, then, there are multiple inflations experienced by different classes across the income and wealth distribution, depending on the basket of goods we consume.

One of the questions that seldom gets asked, that we should probably ask more, is “what is an economy?” When you define it in terms of output, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), it is nothing more than the number of workers multiplied by the number of hours worked multiplied by the quantity and quality of capital with which they work. That’s really it. And that is all you need to explain output quite well. But that process says absolutely nothing about the distribution of that output. That is, who gets to claim a share of it, and why do they get what they get?

We accept the microeconomic truism that “workers get paid according to their marginal contribution to what is produced.” Leaving aside the issue of why bankers get paid hundreds of times more than nurses (are they really that much more productive, even at the margin?), it is only in inflationary times that this conflict comes out into the open. In inflationary times firms want to increase their prices, given what they pay out in wages, while workers want to increase their wages to keep their purchasing power. This is the source of conflict.

Blanchard noted that such pressures can come from exogenous sources such as energy prices unexpectedly spiking, pushing firms to increase their prices to reflect the higher costs of intermediate goods. But it may come from something deeply endogenous to capitalism itself, from workers being in a strong position to bargain for higher wages because of inflation. This is, you will recall, the mechanism behind the price-wage spiral generated from the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve describes a world where for inflation to go down, in theory at least, we need unemployment to go up. In contrast, if unemployment is too low, workers are able to bid for higher wages because there are many other open positions for which they can apply.

workers today are much weaker than they were in the 1970s. As we noted earlier, trade union density has declined sharply over the past several decades, weakening workers’ bargaining power. With the fall in union density, the correlation between wages and inflation has become feebler. On top of that, as David Blanchflower and Alex Bryson have argued, by increasing interest rates central banks undermine low-wage workers’ ability to maintain their current level of consumption through credit. That credit gets more expensive, so such workers consume less, which further reduces labor demand by depressing the economy, which in turn increases the unemployment risk of low-income workers.

there is plenty of evidence that shows how firms used inflation to gain significantly more profits than they are used to, and that happened amid a stagnant growth in real wages.

the IMF estimated that for inflation in Europe, rising corporate profits accounted for almost half (45 percent) of the increase in 2022–23, as shown in Figure 6.3. The second main driver of inflation was import prices resulting from supply-chain disruptions, which accounted for 40 percent of the change. By contrast, labor costs contributed only marginally to the overall increase in prices. The IMF study noted that firms “have passed on more than the nominal cost shock,” meaning that their profits went beyond the price adjustment needed to cope with rising intermediate costs, with the result that companies “have fared relatively better than workers.” Profits, as adjusted for inflation, were 1 percent above pre-pandemic levels, whereas labor costs were about 2 percent below the pre-COVID-19 trend. Added together, that is a big win for firms.

higher profits do not necessarily mean that firms are inflation winners. Counterintuitive as this may sound, the reason lies in the distinction between unit profits and profit markups. While this distinction seems a mere technicality, it is crucial to understand whether firms simply protected themselves from inflation or used it to take from others.

The mechanism behind this markup-driven inflation has been detailed by Isabella Weber and Evan Wasner, whose work we encountered previously. They start from the observation that firms would normally refrain from raising prices as buyers would simply buy the same products from their competitors at a cheaper price. However, sector-wide shocks, such as COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukraine conflict, can lead firms to increase prices under a kind of implicit agreement that other firms in the same sector will follow suit. Knowing this, it becomes safe to raise prices. A crucial next step follows from this observation. While firms may initially do this to protect their profits, they may later on take advantage of this situation to increase their profits. If you tried it once and it worked—no other firm came in with cheaper prices and took your market share—why not do it again? This is even easier when firms have a high degree of market power, which, as we’ve seen, occurs when a few firms dominate an entire sector.

While economists and central bankers keep monitoring unemployment, worried about the start of a wage-price spiral like the 1970s, they all struggle to find it. This is because firms now have more market power and use it to collect more profits via increasing their markups. This is what shows up in higher inflation. Workers are the ones paying for those profits with higher prices.

if a central bank increases the cost of money by charging higher rates, then banks can transfer this cost to their borrowers by charging higher rates on the loans they issue. However, banks should also “reward” their depositors for giving them the money they lent in the first place, as it has become more valuable thanks to inflation. To do so, banks would have to increase their deposit rate. In theory, if they don’t do so, depositors might decide to withdraw their money and deposit it in a bank that pays a higher rate.

banks are required to keep a share of their money as reserves at the central bank. The purpose of these reserve requirements is to avoid a situation where a bank runs out of money and cannot pay back its depositors. If, for some reason, depositors panic and decide to withdraw their money all at once, the bank can still rely on a fraction of the money it has kept at the central bank to be able to pay back most of the deposits it holds on its books. While traditionally these reserves were not remunerated, after the global financial crisis central banks began to pay interest on these reserve balances as a way to manage how much money circulates in the economy and where it ends up—in low-yield safe assets or higher-yield risk assets. That policy shift has provided a very profitable side payment to banks when there is inflation because the central bank effectively gives them “inflation insurance” via “interest on excess reserves.” When the central bank raises rates to counter inflation, the interest rate paid on those reserves goes up too. Paul De Grauwe and Yuemei Ji estimated that in June 2023 the interest payments from central banks to commercial banks amounted to 0.64 percent of GDP in the US (162 billion dollars), 1.13 percent in the euro area (152 billion euros), and 1.75 percent in the UK (39 billion pounds).

Banks win big with inflation. They get to short their depositors, and they get paid for simply parking reserves at the central bank. But these trades against their customers and against the government are not risk-free. Recent turbulence in the US banking sector proves this.

SVB invested a lot of its deposits into fixed-income securities such as Treasury bonds. These securities are highly liquid debt instruments that pay a fixed interest rate on a regular basis. They are generally seen as a very safe investment. While on average banks invest around 24 percent of their assets in these types of securities, SVB decided to invest 55 percent of their assets in Treasury bonds. But if they’re so safe, what’s the problem with holding these securities? The issue is that bond prices and bond rates move inversely. In plain English, if interest rates go up, the value of these bonds falls because new bonds being issued today and tomorrow will pay a higher rate than previously issued ones. This will make the new bonds more attractive to investors. The demand for older bonds will then fall, causing their price (and therefore their value) to fall. A bank that holds a lot of fixed-income bonds risks that an increase in interest rates will result in a fall in the value of its assets. This is not a problem if the bank can wait and hold those bonds until they reach maturity. However, SVB’s depositors got worried and started asking for their money back before SVB’s bonds matured. In order to satisfy these demands, SVB had to sell those assets at the market price and take the losses, until these losses became unsustainable.

If a bank manages to pass only a small share of its gains to depositors, it can profit significantly. If governments are foolish enough to pay interest on excess reserves to banks, then banks can make money by simply showing up at the Fed with money that could be put to work elsewhere. But these are bugs in the system, not features. Banks are (indirectly) inflation winners and inflation users, and they may sometimes be abusers. But their wins are driven by policy, not inflation itself.

Inflation hits the poor the most, and they get compensated the least when it falls. The knee-jerk solution of higher interest rates makes the lives of lower-income individuals and families harder. They’ll face higher payments on their rents, mortgages, and debts as the purchasing power of their income falls. In contrast, inflation helps some corporations boost their profits at the expense of consumers. They really do win. Central bank rate rises have little effect on this. All they can do is reduce firms’ investment by making borrowing more expensive. But this can simply be an additional incentive for firms to focus even more on stashing profits rather than reinvesting them in the firm’s growth, a choice that would ultimately produce unemployment, hurting the poor once again. Finally, higher rates benefit those banks that can hide these gains from their depositors and that are not exposed to interest rate risks.

one of the main arguments we have made is that our underlying theories of inflation are quite fragile and that inflation stories are as much rhetorical devices designed to shove the cost of inflation onto someone else as they are robust scientific theories backed by solid empirical evidence. Another key takeaway was that while money is certainly implicated in inflation, it is never the full, nor often the primary, culprit. A third argument we developed was that inflation is never one thing. Inflation is an experience that varies by class, race, and geography, and our attempts to define it and capture it in various indices often render its workings all the more obscure.

The first reason to think that the future will be deflationary is that the past twenty-five years have been deflationary. That’s quite a trend. From the late 1980s until 2021, at least as far as the OECD countries have been concerned, inflation has been a 1980s horror story,

Think, for example, of the cost of buying a car over time. Imagine a 1979 Volkswagen Golf GTI. Its original price at its UK launch was £4,705, which was $9,536 in 1979 dollars. It was a fabulous car, but it didn’t have airbags, ABS, Bluetooth, navigation, or even air-conditioning. The current version of the GTI is superior in every way possible to the 1979 model and costs $29,880. But when you adjust the price of the 1979 model, that is, you price 1979 dollars as 2022 dollars, that translates into $41,370 of purchasing power today. In short, the 2022 GTI isn’t just qualitatively better, it is significantly cheaper. You get more for less. Why? Because of competition between car manufacturers pushing down prices as they compete on price and quality. After all, in 2022 there are many more alternatives to the GTI than there were in 1978. Competition and technological change means that the world tends to deflate, not inflate. Think of the collapse in the price of solar panels or the cost of non-Apple mobile phones, for example.

Inflation is not a constant danger that we must always guard against. That type of thinking caused the then European Central Bank resident Jean-Claude Trichet to raise interest rates in 2011 in the middle of a deflation, sending the eurozone into a near decade-long recession, which suggests that how we think about inflation can be as dangerous as inflation itself.

The second reason for seeing high inflation as an exception is that if you are suffering from a serious inflation, you are more than likely to have many other more serious problems that are in fact causing the inflation. Former Argentine economy minister Martin Lousteau tells this story of living with hyperinflation in Argentina in the 1990s. When he was a student, prices were rising so rapidly that the first thing he did when he went out for pizza with his classmates was to negotiate with the pizza restaurant whether they wanted to be paid at the start or the end of the meal, because prices would change so much in a few hours. Such an environment is hugely disruptive for business.

Economists who are now superconcerned with runaway deficits and stimulus-driven inflation were a few short years ago concerned with “secular stagnation.” This was the idea that a dearth of investment opportunities, structurally low interest rates, and a reliance on credit bubbles to get the economy moving combined to make economic growth persistently low. The inflation of the past few years made us forget all that. If we return to the pre-pandemic trend, we will return to a path of low growth and low investment, and deflation rather than inflation.

the structure of firms in capitalism, especially in the United States, has turned, as Herman Mark Schwartz puts it, “from Fordism to franchise.” Schwartz demonstrates that the type of firms that made high growth and high wages possible in the postwar era—vertically integrated firms that employed large numbers of workers who could effectively demand their share of productivity gains via unions—has been replaced by an entirely different type of firm. Today, at the top of the global food chain of corporations, sit firms that make huge profits from monopoly or quasi monopoly positions gleaned through the ownership of digital platforms or highly specific intellectual property. Such firms earn huge profits but employ very few workers. They invest little and largely derive profits from subscriptions, fees, and closed-system hardware and software. Think Apple. Below these top firms lie their key suppliers. Think Corning, which makes the glass for iPhones. They employ more people and pay good wages but are limited in their investments by everyone else in the economy below them having little money. Why is this? Because below them are the vast majority of firms that earn almost no profits and pay low wages. Think of the folks selling iPhone cases in the local mall and the fast-food restaurants that serve them. That economic structure creates a squeeze on demand that limits investment by the more profitable firms, which in turn leads to franchise structures further down the food chain, where squeezing labor constitutes the only real source of profit. Think of the last hotel you stayed in and note that the folks cleaning the hotel are not employed by the hotel—it’s all franchised out. In such a world, inflation can only come from external supply shocks and can only be temporary. There is simply not enough demand in the system to get excited about inflation.

Just like the current inflationary episode of 2021–2025, inflation will not come as an ever-accelerating spiral of wages and prices chasing each other up to infinity. Rather, it may appear as a higher and more volatile baseline of costs for all economies. If we take a very long-term perspective on inflation in advanced economies, we immediately notice that prices have become more stable than they used to be. One way to see that is to look at inflation from Bank of England data going back to the year 1200 C.E. In this graph, you can see that periods of inflation and deflation have become less extreme in the twentieth century. Interestingly, while as we just described, there are strong reasons to believe we’re living in a deflationary period, the past several decades have been more inflationary than deflationary, at least at the level of the UK CPI.

think about capitalist economies as being constituted by particular macroeconomic regimes in specific historical periods. That is, as particular bundles of institutions and ideas—the hardware and software of capitalism, if you like—that operate in particular historical periods and that endogenously undermine themselves over time. If we think about the period from 1945 to 1980, capitalist economies typically promoted full employment as the overarching goal of policy, and used a variety of means, from controlling domestic financial markets, limiting international capital flows, and encouraging the growth of trade unions, to force business to share productivity gains with workers in the form of rising wages. To make that work, businesses had to invest in productivity enhancements to achieve that goal and stay in profit. The problem with doing so was that over the long term such a setup pushed up labor’s share of GDP and lowered capital’s share while encouraging inflation. This was, for us, and as we described in prior chapters, the essence of the inflationary crisis of the 1970s.

In response, capital struck back through a disengagement with these institutions and the promotion of a new set of political and economic ideas that we came to know as neoliberalism, which dominated in the period of 1980 to 2008. This “regime shift” modified the hardware of capitalism by shifting much of the governance of the economy to independent central banks and by opening up local economies to global economic integration, most notably with China. These changes sucked the inflation out of these economies as millions of workers with lower cost bases entered global supply chains and restored Western capital’s share of GDP. But this regime was also unstable at its core. The inequality in income and wealth that it generated was covered over by mountains of private credit that eventually came unstuck in the financial crisis of 2008. Stabilizing this, in turn, required equally massive public credit provision by central banks to keep the system going. This time around there was no regime shift, but the instruments used to keep it going, zero interest rates and massive asset purchases, further increased inequality and, through this, political polarization.

The second driver is the new geopolitics of the 2020s. As the developed world “deglobalizes” due to security competition between the United States and China, while at the same time attempting to reindustrialize in order to capture the green technology/climate change adaption market, the costs of new local production will rise while the price of such output will likely fall as supply gluts fail to find end users who sit behind protectionist barriers. The most recent version of this problem, the panic over China’s exports of electric vehicles, is the canary in the coal mine for the bigger issue of every country trying to be an exporter while no one wants to be the importer. Meanwhile, the cost of the critical minerals needed for this reindustrialization drive are only going to go up in the absence of major technological breakthroughs, and they tend to be located in places where such geopolitical competition is most intense.

Globalization, which was essentially moving huge parts of Western productive capital to China to take advantage of massive amounts of cheap labor, was inherently deflationary. That thirty-year period, and the ability to undertake secure just-in-time manufacturing in China, seems to be ending. As a result, the deflationary pressure that came from incorporating China into the global economy is over too. Add to this the reality of a world that is utterly dependent on fossil fuels for growth lacking sufficient local fossil fuels due to these new geopolitics, and we find another reason to expect climate pressures to increasingly show up as inflationary pressures.

The third driver is what we might call the new demographic realities of the already rich world. Quite simply, we are all getting older. The baby boomers are finally leaving our labor markets in their droves and there simply are not enough replacement workers to fill their shoes. It has been estimated that baby boomers in the United States increased inflation by 6 percentage points when they were young, in the period from 1955 to 1975, but decreased it by 5 percentage points when they entered the workforce in 1975 to 1990. In short, as the baby boomers leave, so does their deflationary effect. Empirical evidence shows that if there are too many people who are either too young or too old to work so the workforce shrinks, this has inflationary pressures.

COVID-19 caused the labor force participation rate to fall precipitously at the turn of the decade, at the same time as immigration became extremely politicized in many countries. Labor participation has picked up since COVID-19 and, as we’ve noted previously, despite increasing interest rates, employment in the United States has continually gone up since 2022, not down, which suggests employers are still finding it hard to find workers. Inflation has taken a huge bite out of real (inflation adjusted) wages, but even these are now back to where they were pre-pandemic. All of this suggests to us that inflation may be baked into the DNA of the emergent macroeconomic regime. We may lack a word for it, but we are surely entering a world that is quite different from the world of relatively stable prices we were used to. The green transition—despite how slowly it’s happening and recent backsliding—China’s changing role in the world economy, a new geopolitics of manufacturing, and the aging populations of the Western world (and some Eastern worlds) are all shaping this new macroeconomy.

inflation acts like a tax on future profits as well as on present consumption. If you are an investor with a five-year time horizon and the expected rate of return on your investment is 5 percent when adjusted for inflation, if inflation goes to 10 percent, your borrowing costs just jumped up and your expected profits collapsed. This is why inflations destroy investment. In an inflationary world, it is individually irrational to invest since inflation crushes expected future returns.

The dreams caught on faster than the technologies and wrenched the country out of sync. Three wars destroyed the regime by exposing the gap between east and west, backward and advanced, fantasy and reality. The first was the Crimean War ( 1 8 5 4 - 5 6 ), which underlined the difference between citizen and servile armies; the emancipation of the serfs followed shortly thereafter. The second was the humiliating defeat by Japan (1904-05), the first time Russia had known a setback in its Drang nach Osten. This was followed by the installation of a parliament (the Duma) and popular elections—a good idea in principle but bad for autocracy. The third was World War I, the Great War, when millions of Russian peasants were ordered into clouds of bullets and shrapnel. With that, an incompetent government and military establishment deservedly lost legitimacy, and the regime was overthrown. The whole sequence was a repeat in its way of Spain's long decline: a great ^randustrial power could not cope with the demands and pretensions of better-equipped nations. And like Spain, Russia knew what was happening, but responded with too little, too late

The last of our four sources of funds was international capital flows. Here again, one sees the east-west gradient at work. England invested in French railways; France and Belgium in Prussian ironworks and Austrian banks; Germany in Italian banks and Balkan railways; everybody in Russian mining and industry. In general, money a-plenty followed opportunity a-plenty, with no lack of promoters and pied pipers. Some students of economic development, specialists in Third World backwardness, seek to explain retardation by the unwillingness of rich countries to invest in the poor. The charge does not stand up in history or logic. Businessmen have always been "in it for the money" and will make it and take it where they can. To be sure, they have their preferences. They have always sought to minimize risk and maximize comfort; also have preferred kind climates to unkind, close places to far, familiar cultures to strange. They sometimes make big mistakes. In spite of the greatest care and forethought, not every investment pays off. But this has not stopped businessmen and investors from trying again. It is not want of money that holds back development. The biggest impediment is social, cultural, and technological unreadiness—want of knowledge and knowhow. In other words, want of the ability to use money

as well as being a theory of the world that tells you how it works, economics is also a language of power. To see this in action imagine two politicians vying for office in a public debate. One accuses the other of “economic illiteracy” and is able to use the economic language of “costs, markets, efficiency,” etc. to make the other politician look uninformed and unauthoritative.

Histories are written, as they say, by the victors. The victors in this case were those economists who successfully challenged the “Keynesian consensus” that characterized economic policymaking in the Western world from the 1940s until the 1970s. The postwar Keynesian consensus in economics rested upon a set of ideas concerning markets. Namely, that they were inherently unstable (prone to booms and slumps) and contained no natural tendency to operate at full employment, with the level of employment being determined by the level of output and not the level of income. As such, the job of the government was to push output to the full employment level via fiscal policy, and to keep it there by ensuring sufficient aggregate demand. By the 1960s, it seemed that this task had largely been accomplished. Full employment had become self-sustaining throughout the Western world. But that accomplishment came at a price, which was inflation. The UK, for example, had an annual rate of inflation of around 4 percent from the 1960s onward. The US rate hovered around 3 percent. If growth was 3 percent and inflation was 4 percent, then in real terms the economy was gradually shrinking people’s purchasing power. Trying to get out of this trap while sustaining full employment became the focus of policy. The policy responses took two forms. The first was to try to get ahead of inflation by improving productivity. That was a hard economic problem. The second was to try to control inflation directly through the imposition of controls on prices (which really means profits) and wages. This was thought to be easier, but it turned out to be an even harder political problem.

Keynesian economists tended to see inflation as the result of so-called “cost-push” (labor and product market forces) factors rather than “demand-pull” (monetary) factors. This also suggested a political problem that lay at the heart of the Keynesian order, a problem that an economist named Mikhał Kalecki, whom we have already met when we discussed hyperinflation, diagnosed as far back as 1944. Basically, if a government is committed to maintaining full employment and they achieve that goal, it opens itself up to a situation where workers can strike for higher wages while employers can pass consequently higher prices on to consumers because their rivals face the same labor market conditions. In such a world, “cooling” the economy by raising interest rates would directly conflict with the government’s full-employment target, so using interest rates

they wanted to control price increases “just enough” while hoping that the supply side of the economy would expand to bring prices back down. Inflation, in such an understanding, should therefore be controlled by what was known back then as an “incomes policy.” The problem with implementing an incomes policy is that doing so not only leads to the microeconomic problem of distorting prices. And it also allows governments a much larger say in private capitalist decisions, which is a political problem. As such, economics had to step up to protect private markets from state encroachment.

if you wanted to get government out of the price-setting business, you had to undermine its rationale for doing so, and that meant going after the full-employment target as the basic objective of economic policy. If you could delegitimate that target by using controls to get there, controls would lose their legitimacy too.

what became known as his “expectations augmented” Phillips curve, Friedman created an alternative model of the macroeconomy where attempts by the government to maintain an employment level beyond what he posited as the “natural rate” that the economy could sustain must show up in inflation. In contrast to Keynes, who saw unemployment as “involuntary” and due to a collapse in demand, Friedman made unemployment an entirely voluntary choice, and he gave workers, as we noted in chapter 2, the power to distinguish their real wage from their money wage.

Next, the so-called rational expectations economists entered the fray. Rather than viewing expectations as “augmented” by experience, as Friedman had argued, these economists argued that any attempt by the government to boost the level of employment through boosting demand would be immediately discounted by such agents who would rationally anticipate it. They would know that current spending would have to be paid by future taxes and would therefore save more in the present. By saving, they would end up offsetting the stimulating impact of government’s spending.

It was on the back of these new ideas that a new and quite particular history of the 1970s was constructed. One where shortsighted politicians generated too much demand by spending too much money and/or by generating inflationary cycles and/or by accommodating greedy unions. Given that the economy now has a speed limit defined as its “natural” rate of unemployment—that is, the rate of unemployment at which inflation, theoretically at least, does not accelerate—attempts to go faster than the speed limit can only lead to rising prices.

All academic fields rest upon official histories that tell them how they got to where they are today and why they think the way they do. Economics is not exceptional in that respect. But the story of how this particular history was constructed is exceptional insofar as it wholly ignores causes of the inflation of the 1960s and ’70s that are not agents’ expectations and choices—the key ideas used to undermine the old Keynesian order and its policy goals.

Keynesian economists had pretty good ideas about what caused inflation and how to cure it. They were simply unable to do so for political reasons. According to this alternative view, the core problem of the inflation of the 1960s and ’70s lay in the inability of the Johnson administration to raise taxes to pay for the Vietnam war. Knowing that doing so would cause Congress to choose between guns—the war in Vietnam—and butter—the war on poverty at home—and that Congress would choose to fund the former by cutting the latter, Johnson chose to fight the war “off the books.” As a result, the administration’s economic projections of a slowdown in inflation in the mid-1960s failed to happen as actual war expenditure far exceeded what was being admitted. As then Council of Economic Advisers chief economist Arthur Okun put it at the time, “Everything depends upon Vietnam spending, but we can’t get a goddamned word out of [defense secretary] McNamara.”

Vietnam drove inflation from the demand side. There really was too much (war) money chasing too few goods. The Nixon administration inherited the same policy framework and the same inflationary problems. With five hundred thousand potential workers directly tied up in Vietnam and millions at home supporting this off-the-books war economy, and with women and minorities being increasingly incorporated into the labor markets, which gave the economy a further consumption push, inflation was still being propelled by excessive demand. That demand-pull inflation (too much money) inevitably spilled into cost-push inflation (prices and wages pushing each other upward). In an economy where one third of the labor market was unionized, a spiral of labor militancy, wage increases, and price increases was ignited, exactly as a Keynesian would predict.

In an economically reasonable world, tax increases are a functional substitute for interest rate increases as both reduce economic activity by constraining consumption. But in our very political world, raising taxes is seen as electoral suicide by elected politicians. As a consequence, raising taxes as the control valve for inflation was out of the question, even if it wasn’t already compromised by the prior full-employment target. By the early 1970s, the United States had convinced itself that interest rate rises didn’t work because they couldn’t really raise them enough without making unemployment the inflationary control valve. Tax increases were also off the table. All roads then led to price controls and incomes policies.

It was almost half a century ago, in 1951, that Alexander Gerschenkron wrote his seminal essay on "Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective." In it he posed the question, what does it take for a follower country to undertake industrialization and emulate its predecessors? Or, to put it differently, does it make any difference to come along later

he saw the gap as an incentive in itself, an invitation to effort—like a gap in potential that, when sufficiendy great, is crossed by electrical energy in the form of a spark. (That is my metaphor, but it is not unjustified. Gerschenkron speaks explicitiy of "tension" between "potential" and actual.) In Gerschenkron's model, then, it pays to be late. Not before the leap, but after. (He makes no effort to estimate the cost of relative poverty before industrialization, but he doesn't have to. It's high.) The greater the gap, the greater the gain for those who leap it. Why? Because there's so much more to learn—including mistakes to be avoided. As a result, follower countries grow faster than their predecessors. Their growth is characterized by what Gerschenkron calls a spurt

Late growth, says Gerschenkron, also tends to be based on "the most modern and efficient techniques," because they pay the most and nothing less can compete with more advanced nations. These techniques are typically capital-intensive, which would seem to be irrational for countries that abound in cheap labor. * Gerschenkron recognizes the paradox, but explains it by the quality of the workforce. Good, well-disciplined labor is in fact scarce, he says, scarcer than in richer, more advanced countries. So it pays to substitute capital for labor. That, for Gerschenkron, is half the story. The second half concerns the how: How did backward countries, poor in capital and good labor, manage to create modern, capital-intensive industry? And (although Gerschenkron does little with this part of the story) how did they manage to acquire the knowledge and know-how? Finally, how did they overcome social, cultural, and institutional barriers to industrial enterprise? How did they create appropriate arrangements and institutions? How did they cope with the strains of change

mobilization of capital. He distinguished three levels: (1) a country with lots of private wealth and well-funded merchant banks, able to finance enterprise with family resources, small loans, and reinvestment of profits; (2) a poorer country with fewer and smaller private fortunes, but enough to finance industry if (investment) banks could be created to mobilize these dispersed funds; and (3) a country poorer still, where private wealth was insufficient and only the state could do the job, whether by financing investment banks or by direct subvention. Britain was clearly in the first category; Germany, Austria, and Italy in the second. The United States, Belgium, Switzerland, France came in between. Russia fell in the third group

The French initiatives were a beacon to countries farther east. The Polytechnique in particular sparked emulation in Prague, Vienna, Zurich, places as far off as Moscow. In addition, each country had its own combination of associated schools. The Germans, for example, developed a network of trade schools (Gewerbeschulen) that fed middle technological management; and a growing array of technical higher schools (technische Hochschulen)—the first in Karlsruhe in 1825—that taught at university level and formed generations of chemists and engineers. Finally, the Germans pushed scientific instruction and research in the universities. This was the cutting edge of experiment and inquiry, and the invention of the teaching laboratory (Justus Liebig, 1830s) capped an educational system that became by the end of the century the world's envy and model

The reliance on formal education for the diffusion of technical and scientific knowledge had momentous consequences. First, it almost always entailed instruction in abstract and theoretical matters that lent themselves to a variety of applications, old and new. I would emphasize the new. Secondly, it opened the way to new branches of knowledge of great economic potential. Compare such schooling with the British strategy of learning by doing—the strategy that had driven the Industrial Revolution. This had worked well enough so long as technology remained an accretion of improvements and invention a recombination of known techniques. (Even so, one can only marvel at Britain's continuing ability to generate appropriate genius and talent, much of it autodidact. ) But from the late eighteenth century on, as the frontiers of technological possibility and inquiry moved outward, exploration went beyond the lessons of sensory experience. These new directions found their biggest return in two areas, chemicals and electricity—in both, thanks to advances in scientific knowledge. The older chemical branches remained a kind of industrial cookery: mix, heat, stir, keep the good and dump the waste. They did not stand still. They gained especially from mechanization—bigger and faster kilns, mixers, grinders, and the like—as producers went after economies of scale

the revolutionary advances came in the new field of organic chemistry and derived directly from studies of carbon-based molecules. These opened the door to a multitude of applications, first in the field of dyestuffs (crucial to textile manufacture), then in pharmaceuticals and photography, and finally, toward the end of the century, in artificial matter—what we loosely call plastics

especially to plate metals and cutiery. Both of these were pre-1850. But electricity's flowering came with the invention of generators and dynamos to produce current in quantity and the building of a system of distribution. The biggest stimuli were Thomas Edison's incandescent lighting (1879) and electric motors, which justified the outiay for overhead capital. In both chemicals and electricals, learning and competence depended on formal instruction. These phenomena are not apprehensible by sensory perception; it takes diagrams and schémas to explain them, and the underlying principles are best learned in the classroom and laboratory. Here Continental reliance on schooling paid off, generating and imparting new technologies. Catching up turned into a leap ahead, while Britain, caught in the net of habit, fell behind. In British electricity, moreover, local autonomies exacerbated the difficulty. In some places, municipal gas networks successfully opposed electrification; elsewhere Britain built a multiplicity of power networks, each with its own voltage arrangements and hardware. Later improvements only added to the menu. To this day, British buyers of electrical appliances must deal with a diversity of plugs and outlets, and customers pay shopkeepers to ready equipment for use. The British economy grew in these new branches as it had in the old—like Topsy. This marriage of science and technique opened an era that Simon Kuznets called "modern economic growth.

traordinary cluster of innovations that made the Second Industrial Revolution so important—the use of liquid and gaseous fuels in internal combustion engines, the distribution of energy and power via electric current, the systematic transformation of matter, improved communications (telephone and radio), the invention of machines driven by the new sources of power (motor vehicles and domestic appliances). It was also and above all the role of formally transmitted knowledge. The marriage of science and technique had been preceded by a number of couplings. One can take the courtship back to the Middle Ages, to the use of astronomical knowledge to transform navigation (the calculation of latitudes), the use of mathematics in ballistics, the application of the pendulum to the construction of a far more accurate timekeeper. And back to the steam engine, that classic triumph of scientific empiricism. But not until the late nineteenth century does science get ahead and precede technique. Now would-be inventors and problem solvers found it profitable to survey the literature before undertaking their projects; or for that matter, before conceiving their objective—what to do and how to do it. So it was that the leader/innovator was caught and overtaken. And so it was that all the old advantages—resources, wealth, power—were devalued, and the mind established over matter. Henceforth the future lay open to all those with the character, the hands, and the brains

In the mid-nineteenth century, the alkaloid quinine was of vital importance to British rule in India, where malaria enfeebled and killed civilian and military personnel. Quinine did not cure the disease, but it relieved the symptoms. At that time, quinine was obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree, which was native to Peru. The British government, working through the world-famous botanical gardens at Kew, was making strenuous efforts to obtain cinchona seeds in Peru, nurse them into seedlings, and then plant them in India, but the results proved disappointing. India remained dependent on high-cost imports from Java, where the Dutch had managed to obtain a better transplant. The British would have preferred their own supply

By the early eighteenth century, Britain was well ahead—in cottage manufacture (putting-out), seedbed of growth; in recourse to fossil fuel; in the technology of those crucial branches that would make the core of the Industrial Revolution: textiles, iron, energy and power. To these should be added the efficiency of British commercial agriculture and transport. The advantages of increasing efficiency in agriculture are obvious. For one thing, rising productivity in food production releases labor for other activities—industrial manufacture, services, and the like. For another, this burgeoning workforce needs ever more food. If this cannot be obtained at home, income and wealth must be diverted to the purpose. (To be sure, the need to import nourishment may promote the development of exports that can be exchanged for food, may encourage industry; but necessity does not assure performance

The spread of market gardening (fruits and vegetables) around London in the sixteenth century and the pursuit of mixed farming (grain and livestock and grain-fed livestock) testify to the responsiveness of both landowners and tenants. This development made for richer and more varied diets, with an exceptionally high proportion of animal protein.2 Further contributing was the adoption of new techniques of watering, fertilizing, and crop rotation—many of them brought by immigrants from the Low Countries. The Netherlands were then the seat of European agricultural improvement, a land that man had created (won from the sea) by effort and ingenuity and had cherished accordingly. Dutchmen were already teaching farming in the Middle Ages—to the Slavic frontier. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the English were among the principal beneficiaries

European countries were trying to do the same, but nowhere were these improvements so widespread and effective as in Britain. For a simple reason: nowhere else were roads and canals typically the work of private enterprise, hence responsive to need (rather than to prestige and military concerns) and profitable to users. This was why Arthur Young, agronomist and traveler, could marvel at some of the broad, well-drawn French roads but deplore the lodging and eating facilities. The French crown had built a few admirable king's highways, as much to facilitate control as to promote trade, and Young found them empty. British investors had built many more, for the best business reasons, and inns to feed and sleep the users

Yet to say that is just to tell what and how, not why; to describe rather than to explain.3 This advance cum transformation, this revolution, was not a matter of chance, of "things simply coming together." One can find reasons, and reasons behind the reasons. (In big things, history abhors accident.)4 The early technological superiority of Britain in these key branches was itself an achievement—not God-given, not happenstance, but the result of work, ingenuity, imagination, and enterprise. The point is that Britain had the makings; but then Britain made itself. To understand this, consider not only material advantages (other societies were also favorably endowed for industry but took ages to follow the British initiative), but also the nonmaterial values (culture) and institutions.*

This ideal society would also be honest. Such honesty would be enforced by law, but ideally, the law would not be needed. People would believe that honesty is right (also that it pays) and would live and act accordingly. More corollaries: this society would be marked by geographical and social mobility. People would move about as they sought opportunity, and would rise and fall as they made something or nothing of themselves. This society would value new as against old, youth as against experience, change and risk as against safety. It would not be a society of equal shares, because talents are not equal; but it would tend to a more even distribution of income than is found with privilege and favor. It would have a relatively large middle class. This greater equality would show in more homogeneous dress and easier manners across class lines. N o society on earth has ever matched this ideal. Leaving ignorance aside (how does one know who is better or more meritorious?), this is the machine at 100 percent efficiency, designed without regard to the vagaries of history and fate and the passions of human nature.

Britain had the early advantage of being a nation. By that I mean not simply the realm of a ruler, not simply a state or political entity, but a self-conscious, self-aware unit characterized by common identity and loyalty and by equality of civil status.6 Nations can reconcile social purpose with individual aspirations and initiatives and enhance performance by their collective synergy. The whole is more than the sum of the parts. Citizens of a nation will respond better to state encouragement and initiatives; conversely, the state will know better what to do and how, in accord with active social forces.7 Nations can compete. Britain, moreover, was not just any nation. This was a precociously modern, industrial nation. Remember that the salient characteristic of such a society is the ability to transform itself and adapt to new things and ways, so that the content of "modern" and "industrial" is always changing. One key area of change: the increasing freedom and security of the people. To this day, ironically, the British term themselves subjects of the crown, although they have long—longer than anywhere— been citizens. Nothing did more for enterprise. Here is Adam Smith: The natural effort of every individual to better his own condition, when suffered to exert itself with freedom and security, is so powerful a principle, that it is alone, and without any assistance, not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often incumbers its operations; though the effect of these obstructions is always more or less either to encroach upon its freedom, or to diminish its security. In Great Britain industry is perfectiy secure; and though it is far from being perfecdy free, it is as free or freer than in any other part of Europe

How far to push back the origins of English social precocity is a matter of historical dispute. One scholar would go back to the Middle Ages (pre-1500) and what he calls the rise of individualism. This was a society that shed the burdens of serfdom, developed a population of cultivators rather than peasants, imported industry and trade into the countryside, sacrificed custom to profit

England was far from perfect. It had its poor (always with us)—many more of them than of the rich. It knew abuses of privilege as well as enjoyment of freedom, distinctions of class and status, concentrations of wealth and power, marks of preference and favor. But everything is relative, and by comparison with populations across the Channel, Englishmen were free and fortunate

John Fortescue, later Sir John and chief justice of the Court of King's Bench. In the 1470s Sir John wrote a book on The Governance of England, where he spoke of French misgovernment and misery. The French king, he wrote, does as he pleases and has so impoverished his people that they can scarcely live. They drink water (rather than beer and ale); they eat apples with brown (as against white) bread; they get no meat but maybe some lard or tripe—what's left over from the animals slaughtered for the nobles and merchants. They wear no wool, but rather a canvas frock; their hose, of canvas too and do not go past the knee, so that they go about with bare thighs. Their wives and children go barefoot. They have to watch, labor, and grub in the ground. They "go crooked and be feeble, not able to fight nor to defend the realm." They have no arms, or money to buy arms. "But verily they live in the most extreme poverty and miserie, and yet dwell they in the most fertile realm of the world.

he rhapsodizes about the superiority of his country.

The contribution of high consumption to technological progress struck contemporaries, and more of them as the British advance grew. Without taking a course in Keynesian economics, French merchants understood that mechanization made for high wages, that high wages made for increased demand for manufactures, and that effective demand made for increased prosperity. "Thus, by the working of a system that seems paradoxical, the English have grown rich by consuming."1 4 Paradoxical indeed: such dispendious habits ran against the folk wisdom that counseled thrift and abstemiousness, habits congenial to French peasants compelled to avarice. One result was a manufacture that aimed at a large national and international market and focused on standardized goods of moderate price—just the kind that lent themselves to machine production. "The English," wrote Charles marquis de Biencourt, "have the wit to make things for the people, rather than for the rich," which gave them a large and steady custom

This production, needless to say, though largely directed to home demand, also sold to plantations and colonies and kingdoms abroad. (Small objects of high value in proportion to weight and volume are ideally suited to smuggling. The best example is watches.) Small-town, relatively isolated markets on the European Continent, once reserved for local craftsmen, were now visited by tireless peddlers, bringing with them the outside world. Conservatives resented these intruders, not only for their competition and their foreignness (many peddlers were Jews) but for their threat to order and virtue. The German moralist Justus Môser, writing in the latter eighteenth century of the Osnabruck area in northern Westphalia, denounced the brass of these itinerants. They came to the cottage door while the husband was away (alas for patriarchal authority), tempting the wife with kerchiefs, combs, and mirrors, the instruments of vanity and waste.

Britain was largely free of the irrational constraints on entry that dogged most Continental societies. The stupidest of these were religious:* the persecution and expulsion of Protestants from France (revocation in 1685 of the Edict of Toleration of Henri IV); and the widespread exclusion of Jews from all manner of trades, pardy (psychologically) out of fear and hatred, partly (institutionally) by virtue of the Christian character of craft guilds and the lingering effects of earlier expulsions. Religion, moreover, was not the sole criterion of admission to craft and trade guilds. In parts of Germany, for example, only men "conceived by honorable parents under pure circumstances" (the German is better—von ehrlichc Eltern aus reinem Bett crzeuget) were eligible.1 8 (Some scholars have tried to trivialize the economic consequences of these discriminations, as though for every person excluded, someone just as good or smart or experienced was waiting to step in; or as though these victims of prejudice and hatred were not precious carriers of knowledge and skills to eager competitors.1 9 We need not take these clevernesses seriously; they fail in logic and in fact.) England profited here from other nations' self-inflicted wounds. In the sixteenth century, weavers from the southern Netherlands sought refuge and brought with them the secrets of the "new draperies," and Dutch peasants imported arts of drainage and a more intensive agriculture. In the seventeenth century, Jews and cryptoJews, many of them third- and fourth-stage Marrano victims of Spanish and other persecutions, brought to England an experience of public and private finance;2 0 and Huguenots, merchants and craftsmen, old hands of trade and finance, came with their network of religious and family connections

action was elsewhere; with new men, improving landlords, aristocrats turned entrepreneurs, immigrants from within and without. The energy and busyness of this society could be measured by its material achievements, but also by its values. I would stress here the importance it gave to time and to saving time, because nothing better sums up the priorities. Two pieces of "unobtrusive" evidence: (1) the passionate interest in knowing the time; and (2) the emphasis on speed of transport. The British were in the eighteenth century the world's leading producers and consumers of timekeepers, in the country as in the city (very different here from other European societies). They made them well and pricey; they also batch-produced them and sold them cheap, if necessary on the installment plan. They stole them and resold them: if you couldn't afford a new watch, you could buy an old one from a fence. Impecunious (and honest) would-be watch owners formed pools to buy one and drew for the right to get it. The coaching services reflected this temporal sensibility: schedules to the minute, widely advertised; closely calculated arrival times and transfers; drivers checked by sealed clocks; speed over comfort; lots of dead horses. Note here the contrast with France. Across the Channel the government set speed limits and, to save the roads, required broad-rimmed wheels that rode heavy and slow. The passengers apparentiy did not mind. They preferred economy over time and quite correctiy found that speed clashed with comfort

Why no industrial revolution in India? After all, India had the world's premier cotton industry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, unbeatable for quality, variety, and cost. This industry not only satisfied the large domestic demand but exported roughly half its output throughout the Indian Ocean and indirectiy to Southeast Asia and China. To this huge market, beginning in the seventeenth century, came the stimulus of European demand—a huge shot in the arm that inevitably aggravated old and created new supply problems. Why, then, was there no interest in easing these difficulties by substituting capital (machines) for labor? Indian historians have tended to overlook or reject this omission. Some, especially Indian nationalists, blame it on the Europeans, and most particularly the British

One useful way to approach the problem is to ask, cui bono, who benefits? Who would have gained from mechanization and transformation? Three groups or interests were involved: the workers (spinners and weavers); the middlemen, who typically advanced

capital to the weavers against the promise of delivery; and the European traders and chartered companies, who wanted to buy for both the country (intra-Asian) trade and their European clientele. It would be unreasonable to expect capital-using technological innovations from the first group. Workers had an obvious interest in getting materials (cotton fiber for spinners, yarn for weavers), but here they simply counted on merchant intermediaries. They had neither means nor the habit of command

If there was to be a move to technological change, then, it would have to come from the Indian middlemen, who had both interest and, some of them, means; or from the European chartered companies. Yet neither budged. Why not? Some explanations have been based on an implicit law of conservation of energy. The supply of labor was elastic, so it was easier and more economical to hire additional workers, from among untouchables and poor women for spinning, from agricultural laborers for weaving, than to look to change in technology; and that may well be the whole of the story.2 5 Also, any unanticipated surge in demand (demand was segmented and different markets wanted different fabrics) could be met by shifting goods among markets, from domestic to foreign and from one foreign to another. It was even possible, though very difficult, to assemble large numbers of workers "under one r o o f (in one place), to toil under supervision. This was the sort of thing the foreign trading companies tried to do, by way of ensuring prompt completion of tasks. In some instances such concentration yielded economies of scale and materials—in fuel-using branches

One reason for this "general indifference": no one seems to have had a passionate interest in simplifying and easing tasks. Both worker and employer saw hard labor as the worker's lot—and as appropriate. Indifference, moreover, was promoted by segmentation: it was not the cloth merchant's job to find, assemble, and deliver the raw materials. He advanced capital, and it was up to weaver and spinner to do the rest. This was significantiy different from puttingout as practiced in Europe, where the merchant took part in the production process. In India, then, the final buyer was cut off from the means of remedy. The worker did what he had always done, and so did the merchant. Dutch records tell us that merchants kept weavers "on a short leash," paying them by the day so that they could not get ahead and run off, presumably with the goods.2 8 Some merchants hired agents to keep an eye on the weavers and check their progress. The aim here was to prevent the weaver, who invariably consumed his advance by the time he finished the work, from selling his finished piece to another buyer. We hear of agents who would enter the weaver's house and cut the cloth from the loom, even though not completely done. Come back a day later, and it might be gone, and nine tenths of a piece was better than none. The European companies in turn learned to accommodate these irregularities. Markets failed at times, but both Indians and Europeans seem to have viewed these lapses as a fact of life. Like famine: This too shall pass. The industry seems to have followed its own leisurely pace, which was not irrational. (It is ends that determine which means are rational.) In the Coromandel (southeast coast), for example, the raw cotton was moved from the interior to the spinning and weaving villages on and near the coast by huge bullock trains numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands, the whole shapeless mass feeding while shambling along at a rate of a few miles a day. Since the trek covered some three hundred or more miles, it took about half a year to deliver the goods.2 9 Meanwhile the European companies' own rhythm of purchases and shipments reflected the irregularities of shipping and of capital availability, to say nothing of fluctuations in supply. Data, for example, on shipments by the East India Company of textiles from Bombay show a high variance, ranging from a few thousand (zero in one year) to almost a million pieces.3 0

Besides, it was not obvious to the East India Company that direct assistance to the Indian cotton industry was politically wise. British manufacturing interests would have seen that as treason. Toward the end of the seventeenth century a pamphleteer denounced the prospect that merchants would send over to India "Cloth-Weavers, and Dyers, and Throwsters, as well as Silk." D o that, he warned, and "I question not but we shall have Cotton-Cloth and Knaves enough to make it a fashion and Fools enough to wear it." The company made haste to deny the charge.

Indian society did know technological change: the most important in the textile manufacture came with the substitution of the wheel for the distaff (though not for the finest muslin yarn). But innovation took place within the conventional manual context, and a big conceptual and social difference separates machines and hand tools. One must distinguish further between all-purpose tools and specialized: Indian artisans, however skilled, had scarcely started on the path to instrumentation

iron nails were rare. Their absence made a difference in shipbuilding. European ships were nailed and spiked; Indian vessels tied the planking to the hull with cords and ropes and rabbeted and glued the boards end to end.3 4 This manual mode explains as much as anything the failure of nonEuropean craftsmen to make clocks and watches as good as Europe's. They had the hands, the "matchless ingenuity," but not the tools. They did extraordinary work, in musket making for example. "Even today, 1786," wrote a French convert to Islam named Haji Mustafa, "Colonel Martin, a Frenchman, who has gready distinguished himself these twenty-two years in the English service, has at Lucknow a manufactory where he makes pistols and fuzils better, both as to lock and barrel, than the best arms that come from Europe."3 5 But these gifted craftsmen made each piece differendy, because they could not or would not work by instruments.

The Indians, like the Chinese, were not doing anything in this area.3 6 Under the circumstances, the move to machinery in India was not to be envisaged. Such a leap would have entailed a shift from hand skills nurtured from childhood, linked to caste identity and division of labor by sex and age. It would also have required imagination outside the Indian cultural and intellectual experience. As Chaudhuri puts it: "In eighteenth-century India the empirical basis for an Industrial Revolution was conspicuously lacking. There had been no marked progress in scientific knowledge for many centuries, and the intellectual apparatus for a diffusion and systematic recording of the inherited skills was seriously defective."3 7 And still in the nineteenth century: the British engineers who built the Indian railways understood that Indian labor, cheap as it was, would move earth and rock by hand; but they also took for granted that the Indians would use wheelbarrows. Not at all: the Indians were used to moving heavy burdens in a basket on their head and refused to change. We even have one report of Indian laborers placing barrows on their head rather than wheel them. Presumably such resistance reflected a desire to spread the work and increase

This powerful combination of perception with measurement, verification, and mathematized deduction—this new method—was the key to knowing. Its practical successes were the assurance that it would be protected and encouraged whatever the consequences. Nothing like it developed anywhere else.1 0 How to experiment was another matter. One first had to invent research strategies and instruments of observation and measurement, and almost four centuries would elapse before the method bore fruit in the spectacular advances of the seventeenth century. Not that knowledge stood still. The new approach found early application in astronomy and navigation, mechanics and warfare, optics and surveying—all of them practical matters. But it was not until the late sixteenth century, with Galileo Galilei, that experiment became a system

pursuit of precision marked the development of time measurement. Astronomers and physicists needed to time events to the minute and second, and Christian Huygens gave that to them with the invention of the pendulum clock in 1657 and the balance spring in 1675. Scientists also needed to calculate better and faster, and here John Napier's logarithms were as important in their day as the invention of the abacus in an earlier time, or of calculators and computers later.1 2 And they needed more powerful tools of mathematical analysis, which they got from René Descartes's analytic geometry and, even more, from the new calculus of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.

the vernier scale (Pierre Vernier, 1580-1637), and this in turn was followed by the invention of the micrometer (Gascoigne, 1639, but long ignored; and Adrien Auzout, 1666), which used fine wires for reading and a screw (rather than a slide) to achieve close control. The result was measures to the tenth and less of a millimeter that substantially enhanced astronomical accuracy.1 1 (Note that just learning to make precision screws was a major achievement; also that the usefulness of these instruments depended pardy on eyeglasses and magnifying lenses.

Routinization: The third institutional pillar of Western science was the routinization of discovery, the invention of invention. Here was a widely dispersed population of intellectuals, working in different lands, using different vernaculars—and yet a community. What happened in one place was quickly known everywhere else, pardy thanks to a common language of learning, Latin; partly to a precocious development of courier and mail services; most of all because people were moving in all directions

In general, fame was the spur, and even in those early days, science was a contest for priority. That was why it became so important to show-and-tell to aficionados, often in elegant salons; these ladies and gendemen were witnesses to achievement. And that was why scientists, amateur and professional, were so keen to found journals and get dated articles published. Also to replicate experiments, verify results, correct, improve, go beyond. Here again the role of the printing press and movable type was crucial; also the shift from Latin, an invaluable means of international communication among savants of different countries, to the vernacular, the language of the larger public. Again, nothing like these arrangements and facilities for propagation was to be found outside Europe

In fourteenth-century Italy, gifted mechanics (we do not know their names) found ways to throw silk, that is, to spin silk warp, by machine; and even more impressive, to drive these devices by waterpower. On the basis of this technique, the Italian silk industry prospered for centuries, to the envy of other countries. The French managed to pierce the secret in 1670, the Dutch at about the same time; and in 1716,

This was a factory, comparable in almost every way to the cotton mills of a later era. Almost. . . the difference was that the Lombe mill at Derby, along with the hand-operated throwsters' shops that had preceded it and some smaller machine imitators, was more than enough to accommodate England's demand for silk yarn. Silk, after all, was a cosdy raw material, and the silk manufacture catered to a small and affluent clientele. So the Lombe mill, fifty years ahead of those first cotton mills of the 1770s, was not the model for a new mode of production. One could not get an industrial revolution out of silk

Wool and cotton were something else again. When wool sneezed, all Europe caught cold; cotton, and the whole world fell ill. Wool was much the more important in Europe, and cotton's role in the Industrial Revolution was in some ways an accident. The British "calico acts" (1700 and 1721), which prohibited the import and even wearing of East Indian prints and dyestuffs, were intended to protect the native woolen and linen manufacturers, but inadvertentiy sheltered the still infant cotton industry; and while cotton was a lusty infant, it was still much smaller than the older branches at midcentury. The first attempts to build spinning machines aimed at wool, because that was where the profit lay. But when wool fibers proved troublesome and cotton docile, inventors turned their attention to the easier material. Also, the encrustation of the woolen industry and the vested power of its workforce impeded change. Cotton, growing fast, recruiting new hands, found it easier to impose new ways. This is a constant of technological innovation as process: it is much easier to teach novelty to inexperienced workers than to teach old dogs new tricks

the dispersion of activity across hill and dale was driving up costs of distribution and collection. Meanwhile, trying to meet demand, employers raised wages, that is, they increased the price they paid for finished work. To their dismay, however, the higher income simply permitted workers more time for leisure, and the supply of work actually diminished. Merchant-manufacturers found themselves on a treadmill. In defiance of all their natural instincts, they came to wish for higher food prices. Perhaps a rise in the cost of living would compel spinners and weavers to their task.* The workers, however, did respond to market incentives. They were contractors as well as wage laborers, and this dual status gave them opportunity for self-enrichment at the expense of the putter-out. Spinners and weavers would take materials from one merchant and then sell the finished article to a competitor, stalling now one, now another, and juggling their obligations to a fare-thee-well. They also learned to set some of the raw material aside for their own use

The workers liked the freedom from discipline, the privilege of stopping and going as they pleased. Work rhythms reflected this independence. Weavers typically rested and played long, well into the week, then worked hard toward the end in order to make delivery and collect pay on Saturday. On Fridays they might work through the night. Saturday night was for drinking, and Sunday brought more beer and ale. Monday (Saint Monday) was equally holy, and Tuesday was needed to recover from so much holiness.

the gathering of workers under one roof, there to labor under surveillance and supervision. But manufacturers found that they had to pay to persuade people out of cottages and into mills. So long as the equipment in the mill was the same as in the cottage, mill production cost more. The only operations where this law did not hold was in heat-using technologies (fulling, brewing, glassmaking, ironmaking, and the like). There the savings yielded by concentration (one hearth as against many) more than compensated for the capital costs.*

Galileo needed even closer measurements for his studies of acceleration. Ever ingenious, he used small, hand-held water clocks rather than mechanical clocks, opening and closing the outflow hole with his finger at the start and end of the run. He then weighed the water released as a measure of time elapsed, for in those days, the balance scale was the most precise measuring instrument known. The invention of the pendulum clock changed everything. This was the first horological device controlled by an oscillator with its own intrinsic frequency. Earlier clocks used a controller (swinging bar or circle) whose frequency varied with the force applied. After improvements (all inventions need improvements), a good pendulum clock kept time to a few seconds per day

The invention of the balance spring, however, made it possible to get much closer to a regular rate, steady from hour to hour and day to day. A good pocketwatch, jeweled and with a decent balance, could keep time in the early eighteenth century to a minute or two a day. For the first time it paid to add a minute hand, and even a second hand. These advances substantially enhanced the advantage that horological technology gave to Europe. What had long been an absolute monopoly of knowledge remained an effective monopoly of performance. N o one else could make these instruments or do the kinds of work that depended on precision timekeeping.

In the eighteenth century, a series of inventions transformed the British cotton manufacture and gave birth to a new mode of production—the factory system.* At the same time, other branches of industry made comparable and often related advances, and all of these together, mutually reinforcing, drove further gains on an everwidening front. The abundance and variety of these innovations almost defy compilation, but they fall under three principles: (1) the substitution of machines—rapid, regular, precise, tireless—for human skill and effort; (2) the substitution of inanimate for animate sources of power, in particular, the invention of engines for converting heat into work, thereby opening an almost unlimited supply of energy; and (3) the use of new and far more abundant raw materials, in particular, the substitution of mineral, and eventually artificial, materials for vegetable or animal substances. These substitutions made the Industrial Revolution. They yielded a rapid rise in productivity and, with it, in income per head

In ages past, better living standards had always been followed by a rise in population that eventually consumed the gains. Now, for the first time in history, both the economy and knowledge were growing fast enough to generate a continuing flow of improvements. Gone, Malthus's positive checks and the stagnationist predictions of the "dismal science"; instead, one had an age of promise and great expectations. The Industrial Revolution also transformed the balance of political power—within nations, between nations, and between civilizations; revolutionized the social order; and as much changed ways of thinking as ways of doing.

an "instance of great change or alteration in affairs or some particular thing"—a sense that goes back to the 1400s and antedates by a century and a half the use of "revolution" to denote abrupt political change.1 It is in this sense that knowing students of the Industrial Revolution have always used it, just as others speak of a medieval "commercial revolution" or a seventeenth-century "scientific revolution" or a twentieth-century "sexual revolution." The emphasis, then, is on deep rather than fast. It will surprise no one that the extraordinary technological advances of the great Industrial Revolution (with capital I and capital R) were not achieved overnight. Few inventions spring mature into the world. On the contrary: it takes a lot of small and large improvements to turn an idea into a technique. Take steampower. The first device to use steam to create a vacuum and work a pump was patented in England by Thomas Savery in 1698; the first steam engine proper (with piston) by Thomas Newcomen in 1705. Newcomen's atmospheric engine (so called becuase it relied simply on atmospheric pressure) in turn was grossly wasteful of energy because the cylinder cooled and had to be reheated with every stroke. The machine therefore worked best pumping water out of coal mines, where fuel was almost a free good

A long time—sixty years—passed before James Watt invented an engine with separate condenser (1768) whose fuel efficiency was good enough to make steam profitable away from the mines, in the new industrial cities; and it took another fifteen years to adapt the machine to rotary motion, so that it could drive the wheels of industry. In between, engineers and mechanics had to solve an infinitude of small and large problems of manufacture and maintenance

Another line remained to be explored: highpressure engines (more than atmospheric), which could be built more compact and used to drive ships and land vehicles. This took another quarter century. Such uses put a premium on fuel economy: space was limited, and one wanted room for cargo rather than for coal. The answer was found in compounding—the use of high-pressure steam to drive two or more pistons successively; the steam, having done its work in a high-pressure cylinder, expanded further in a larger, lower-pressure cylinder. The principle was the same as that developed in the Middle Ages for squeezing energy out of falling water by driving a series of wheels. Compounding went back to J. C. Hornblower (1781) and Arthur Woolf (1804); but it did not come into its own until the 1850s, when it was introduced into marine engines and contributed mightily to oceanic trade.

The size and power of steam engines were limited by the piston's inertia. Driving back and forth, it required enormous energy to reverse direction. The solution was found (Charles A. Parsons, 1884) in converting from reciprocating to rotary motion, by replacing the piston with a steam turbine. These were introduced into central power plants at the very end of the nineteenth century

The machine itself is simply an articulated device to move a tool (or tools) in such wise as to do the work of the hand. Its purpose may be to enhance the force and speed of the operator as with a printing press, a drill press, or a spinning wheel. Or it may channel its tool so as to perform uniform, repetitious motions, as in a clock. Or it may align a battery of tools so as to multiply the work performed by a single motion

In metallurgy, big gains came from substituting rotary for reciprocating motion: making sheet metal by rolling instead of pounding; making wire by drawing through a sequence of ever narrower holes; making holes by drilling instead of punching; planing and shaping by lathe rather than by chisel and hammer. Most important was the growing recourse to precision gauging and fixed settings. Here the clockand watchmakers and instrument makers gave the lead. They were working smaller pieces and could more easily shape them to the high standards required for accuracy with special-purpose tools such as wheel dividers and tooth-cutters. These devices in turn, along with similar tools devised by machinists, could then be adapted to work in larger format, and it is no accident that cotton manufacturers, when looking for skilled craftsmen to build and maintain machines, advertised for clockmakers; or that the wheel trains of these machines were known as "clockwork." The repetitious work of these machines suggested in turn the first experiments in mass production based on interchangeable parts (clocks, guns, gun carriages, pulley blocks, locks, hardware, furniture). All these gains, plus the invention of machines to build machines, came together in the last third of the eighteenth century—a period of contagious novelty. Some of this merging stream of innovation may have been a lucky harvest. But no. Innovation was catching because the principles that underlay a given technique could take many forms, find many uses. If one could bore cannon, one could bore the cylinders of steam engines. If one could print fabrics by means of cylinders (as against the much slower block printing), one could also print wallpaper that way; or print word text far faster than by the up-and-

strokes of a press and turn out penny tabloids and cheap novels by the tens and hundreds of thousands. Similarly, a modified cotton-spinning machine could spin wool and flax. Indeed, contemporaries argued that the mechanization of cotton manufacture forced these other branches to modernize: . . . had not the genius of Hargreaves and Arkwright changed entirely the modes of carding and spinning cotton, the woollen manufacture would probably have remained at this day what it was in the earliest ages. . . . That it would have been better for general society if it had so remained, we readily admit; but after the improved modes of working cotton were discovered, this was impossible.6 And on and on, into a brave and not-so-brave world of higher incomes and cheaper commodities, unheard-of devices and materials, insatiable appetites.

Industrial Revolution was uneven and protracted in its effects; that it started and flourished in some branches before others; that it left behind and even destroyed old trades while building new; that it did not, could not, replace older technologies overnight.

Rotary motion's great advantage over reciprocating motion lies in its energetic efficiency: it does not require the moving part to change direction with each stroke; it continues round and round. (It has of course its own constraints, arising largely from centrifugal force, which is subject to the same laws of motion.) Everything is a function of mass and velocity: work slowly enough with light equipment, and reciprocating motion will do the job, though at a cost. Step up to big pieces and higher speeds, and reciprocating motion becomes unworkable. Nothing illustrates the principle better than the shift from reciprocating to rotary steam engines in steamships. Both merchant marines and navies were pressing designers and builders for ever larger and faster vessels. For Britain, the world's leading naval power, the definitive decision to go over to the new technology came with the building of Dreadnought) the first of the big-gun battieships. This was in 1905. The Royal Navy wanted a capital ship that could make 21 knots, a speed impossible with reciprocating engines. Although earlier vessels had been designed for 18 or 19 knots, they could do this only for short periods; eight hours at even 14 knots, and the engine bearings would start heating up and breaking down. A hard run could mean ten days in port to readjust—not a recipe for combat readiness. Some of the naval officers were afraid to take chances with the new technology. It was one thing to use turbines on destroyers, but on the Navy's largest, most powerful ship!? What if the innovators were wrong? Philip Watts, Director of Naval Construction, settled the issue by pointing to the cost of old ways. Fit reciprocating engines, he said, and the Dreadnought would be out of date in five years

The turn of the eighteenth century was both end and beginning. It saw the liquidation of the Dutch East India Company; the prohibition of the British Atlantic slave trade (but not the end of slavery);* the peak and decline of the sugar bonanza (including revolution and the fall of planters and plantations in Saint-Domingue [now Haiti]); an end to the Old Regime in France; an end to the period of Old Empire. The new era would see Europe lose formal control of territory overseas (Spain would be the big loser) but gain wider economic dominance. Europe would also force its way into territories previously seen as inaccessible and untouchable (China, Japan), while creating in others (India, Indonesia) a new kind of imperium in its own image

For some nations, Spain for example, the Opening of the World was an invitation to wealth, pomp, and pretension—an older way of doing things, but on a bigger scale. For others, Holland and England, it was a chance to do new things in new ways, to catch the wave of technological progress. And for still others, such as the Amerindians or Tasmanians, it was apocalypse, a terrible fate imposed from without. The Opening brought first an exchange—the so-called Columbian exchange—of the life forms of two biospheres. The Europeans found in the New World new peoples and animals, but above all, new plants— some nutritive (maize [Indian corn], cocoa [cacao], potato, sweet potato), some addictive and harmful (tobacco, coca), some industrially useful (new hardwoods, rubber). These products were adapted diversely into Old World contexts, some early, some late (rubber does not become important until the nineteenth century

The new foods altered diets around the world. Corn, for example, became a staple of Italian (polenta) and Balkan (mamaliga) cuisines; while potatoes became the main starch of Europe north of the Alps and Pyrenees, even replacing bread in some places (Ireland, Flanders). So important was the potato that some historians have seen it as the source and secret of the European population "explosion" of the nineteenth century.1 But not only in Europe. Grown on poor, hilly soils, the potato, along with peanuts, sweet potatoes, and yams, provided a valuable dietary supplement for a Chinese population that in the eighteenth century began to outstrip the nourishment provided by rice. In return, Europe brought to the New World new plants—sugar, cereals; and new fauna—the horse, horned cattle, sheep, and new breeds of dog. Some of these served as weapons of conquest; or like the catde and sheep, took over much of the land from its inhabitants. Worse yet by far, the Europeans and the black slaves they brought with them from Africa carried nasty, microscopic baggage: the viruses of smallpox, measles, and yellow fever; the protozoan parasite of malaria; the bacillus of diphtheria; the rickettsia of typhus; the spirochete of yaws; the bacterium of tuberculosis. To these pathogens, the residents of the Old World had grown diversely resistant. Centuries of exposure within Eurasia had selected human strains that stood up to such maladies. The Amerindians, on the other hand, died in huge numbers, in some places all of them, to the point where only the sparsity of survivors and some happy strains of resistance enabled a few to pull through

personal habits, social customs—could make all the difference. Thus the Indian Ocean area was three to four times more virulent than the temperate zones; the West Indies and American tropics up to ten times more; and West Africa was a one-way door to death.

Oceanic migrations, then, voluntary and involuntary (slaves), brought much death into the world and much woe. But also riches and opportunity for the Europeans, whether leavers or stayers. That is the law of migration in market societies: people go to improve their situation, and so doing, enhance the bargaining power of those left behind; while in their new home they create or seize wealth (food, timber, minerals, or manufactures) to ship or take back to the old country. These gains were realized only slowly. Not until the nineteenth century did improvements in transport open the American Midwest to commercial agriculture. These same advances made immigration much cheaper and easier, just in time to tap an unprecedented upswing in European population

The Columbian exchange redistributed wealth as well as flora and fauna—a one-stage transfer from old rich to new. The primary economic significance of the influx of wealth from overseas, however, lay in its uneven effects. Some people got rich only to spend; others to save and invest. The same with countries: some were little richer in the end than at the beginning, while others used their new fortune to grow more money. Ironically, the nations that had started it all, Spain and Portugal, ended up losers. Here lies one of the great themes of economic history and theory. All models of growth, after all, stress the necessity and power of capital—capital as substitute for labor, easer of credit, balm of hurt projects, redeemer of mistakes, great enterprise's second chance, chief nourisher of economic development.

Spain chose to spend—on luxury and war. War is the most wasteful of uses: it destroys rather than builds; it knows no reason or constraints; and the inevitable unevenness and shortage of resources lead to ruthless irrationality, which simply increases costs. Spain spent all the more freely because its wealth was unexpected and unearned. It is always easier to throw away windfall wealth

In the meantime, the wealth of the Indies went less and less to Spanish industry because the Spanish did not have to make tilings any more; they could buy them.5 In 1545, Spanish manufacturers had a six-year backlog of orders from the New World. At that time, in principle, the overseas empire was required to buy from Spanish producers only. But customers and profits were waiting, and Spanish merchants turned to foreign suppliers while using their own names to cover the transactions. So much for rules. Nor did the American treasure go to Spanish agriculture; Spain could buy food. As one happy Spaniard put it in 1675, the whole world is working for us: Let London manufacture those fabrics of hers to her heart's content; Holland her chambrays; Florence her cloth; the Indies their beaver and vicuna; Milan her brocades; Italy and Flanders their linens, so long as our capital can enjoy them. The only thing it proves is that all nations train journeymen for Madrid and that Madrid is the queen of Parliaments, for all the world serves her and she serves nobody.6 Such foolishness is still heard today, in the guise of comparative advantage and neoclassical trade theory. I have heard serious scholars say that the United States need not worry about its huge trade deficit with Japan. After all, the Japanese are giving us useful things in exchange for paper printed with the portrait of George Washington. That sounds good, but it's bad. Wealth is not so good as work, nor riches so good as earnings. A Moroccan ambassador to Madrid in 1690-91 saw the problem clearly: . . . the Spanish nation today possesses the greatest wealth and the largest income of all the Christians. But the love of luxury and the comforts of civilization have overcome them, and you will rarely find one of this nation who engages in trade or travels abroad for commerce as do the other Christian nations such as the Dutch, the English, the French, the Genoese and their like. Similarly, the handicrafts practiced by the lower classes and common people are despised by this nation, which regards itself as superior to the other Christian nations. Most of those who practice these crafts in Spain are Frenchmen [who] flock to Spain to look for work . . . [and] in a short time make great fortunes

Spain, in other words, became (or stayed) poor because it had too much money. The nations that did the work learned and kept good habits, while seeking new ways to do the job faster and better. The Spanish, on the other hand, indulged their penchant for status, leisure, and enjoyment—what Carlo Cipolla calls "the prevalent hidalgo mentality." They were not alone. Everywhere in Europe, genteel living was honored and manual labor scorned; in Spain, however, more so, partly because a frontier, combative society is a poor school for patience and hard work, pardy because the crafts and tasks of industry and agriculture were long especially associated with despised minorities such as Jews and Muslims

By the time the great bullion inflow had ended in the midseventeenth century, the Spanish crown was deep in debt, with bankruptcies in 1557, 1575, and 1597. The country entered upon a long decline. Reading this story, one might draw a moral: Easy money is bad for you. It represents short-run gain that will be paid for in immediate distortions and later regrets

Europe's shift in economic gravity northward obviously transcends the inglorious Spanish fiasco. The great old mercantile and industrial city-states of Italy—Venice, Florence, Genoa—also lost out. Italy had been at the forefront of the medieval commercial revolution and had led the way out of autarky into international trade and division of labor. As late as the sixteenth century, Italy was a major player, splendid in its manufactures, preeminent in the commercial and banking services rendered to Spain and northern Europe. Yet Italy never really seized the opportunities offered by the Great Opening: one does not find Italian ships in the Indian ocean or crossing the Atlantic. Italy was centered in, caught in, the great Inland Sea. Caught also by old structures: guild controls fettered industry, made it hard to adapt to changing tastes. Labor costs stayed high because manufacture was largely confined to urban, corporate workshops employing adult male craftsmen who had done their years of apprenticeship

The "decline and fall" of Spain is like that of Rome: it poses the fascinating problem of success vs. failure, and scholars will never get tired of it. Probably the most provocative explanation is the one offered by the German social scientist Max Weber. Weber, who began as a historian of the ancient world but grew into a wonder of diversified social science, published in 1904-05 one of the most influential and provocative essays ever written: "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism." His thesis: that Protestantism—more specifically, its Calvinist branches—promoted the rise of modern capitalism, that is, the industrial capitalism that he knew from his native Germany

In manufacturing centers (fabriques) in France and western Germany, Protestants were typically the employers, Catholics the employed. In Switzerland, the Protestant cantons were the centers of export manufacturing industry (watches, machinery, textiles); the Catholic ones were primarily agricultural. In England, which by the end of the sixteenth century was overwhelmingly Protestant, the Dissenters (read Calvinists) were disproportionately active and influential in the factories and forges of the nascent Industrial Revolution

Good Protestants were expected to read the holy scriptures for themselves. (By way of contrast, Catholics were catechized but did not have to read, and they were explicidy discouraged from reading the Bible.) The result: greater literacy and a larger pool of candidates for advanced schooling; also greater assurance of continuity of literacy from generation to generation. Literate mothers matter.

Not only money moved, but knowledge as well; and it was knowledge, specifically scientific knowledge, that dictated economic possibilities. In the centuries before the Reformation, southern Europe was a center of learning and intellectual inquiry: Spain and Portugal, because they were on the frontier of Christian and Islamic civilization and had the benefit of Jewish intermediaries; and Italy, which had its own contacts. Spain and Portugal lost out early, because religious passion and military crusade drove away the outsiders (Jews and then the conversos) and discouraged the pursuit of the strange and potentially heretical; but Italy continued to produce some of Europe's leading mathematicians and scientists. It was not an accident that the first learned society (the Accadémia dei Lincei, Rome, 1603) was founded there.* The Protestant Reformation, however, changed the rules. It gave a big boost to literacy, spawned dissents and heresies, and promoted the skepticism and refusal of authority that is at the heart of the scientific endeavor. The Catholic countries, instead of meeting the challenge, responded by closure and censure

he Romans had a saying, Pecunia non olet—Money does not J L smell. People may not like the way it was made or the person who made it, but they like, and will take, the money. In another sense, though, money does smell, powerfully, and its odor will draw people from far and near. In 1592, England was at war with Spain and Portugal, which we saw had been joined to the Spanish crown by the play of marriage and inheritance. Some four years before, the English had repelled and destroyed a Spanish seaborne invasion (the self-styled Invincible Armada). Now an English naval squadron was waiting off the Azores to intercept and capture Spanish ships coming from the New World and perhaps laden with the treasure of Mexico or Peru, when along came a Portuguese carrack. This was the Madré de Deus, back from the East Indies

headed for Lisbon.* She was bigger than any vessel the English had ever seen: 165 feet long, 47 feet of beam, 1,600 tons, three times the size of the biggest ship in England; seven decks, thirty-two guns plus other arms, gilded superstructure; and her hold was filled with treasure. Here was the stuff of dreams—chests bulging with jewels and pearls, gold and silver coins, amber older than England, bolts of the finest cloth, tapestries fit for a palace, 425 tons of pepper, 45 tons of cloves, 35 tons of cinnamon, 3 of mace, 3 of nutmeg, 2.5 tons of benjamin (a highly aromatic balsamic resin used as base in perfumes and pharmaceuticals), 25 tons of cochineal (a dyestuff made from the dried bodies of the female of an insect found in semitropical climes), 15 tons of ebony. Even before the English squadron commander could take charge of the prize, his rampaging crewmen had stuffed their pockets with everything they could carry. When the prize came into Dartmouth Harbor, it towered over the other ships and the small houses at quayside. Traders, dealers, cutpurses, and thieves came from miles around, from London and beyond, like bees to honey—to visit the ship (the local fishermen plied ceaselessly and expensively between vessel and shore) and seek out drunken sailors in the taverns and dives, the better to buy, steal, pilfer, and fence the loot. By English law, a large share of this catch was owed to the queen; and when Elizabeth learned what was going on, she sent Sir Walter Raleigh down there to get her money back and punish the looters. "I mean to strip them as naked as ever they were born," swore the valiant Sir Walter, "for Her Majesty has been robbed and that of the most rare things." By the time Sir Walter took things in hand, a cargo estimated at half a million pounds—nearly half of all the monies in the Exchequer—had been reduced to £140,000. Even so, it took ten freighters to carry the treasure around the coast and up the Thames to London

The English came into the Indian Ocean, like the Hollanders, at the end of the sixteenth century. They came as interlopers and plunderers, better at fighting than trading. Only later, and then cautiously, did they shift to commerce. The Dutch formed their V O C by merger of independent companies, and moved vessels and armaments into the area on a substantial scale, with a view to booting the Portuguese and other pretenders from the Indonesian archipelago. The English, by contrast, acted piecemeal, treating each voyage as a separate venture and requiring participating merchants to reassemble their capital each time. When the English and Dutch clashed in those early days, the English sometimes won but lacked the muscle to mount a real challenge; and so, looking for alternative trade opportunities, they turned north to India. This would prove a lucky strike. Like the Dutch, the English preferred to avoid the Portuguese. They set up at first on the eastern or Coromandel coast, well away from Malabar. On the western side of India they leapfrogged Goa to obtain trading privileges in Surat, the major port of the Moghul empire, gateway to the riches of the Indian interior and the trade with Persia and Arabia. Later on ( 1661 ) they got permission to set up in Bombay, then an almost uninhabited island. This was reasonably safe from landside aggression (compare Goa), and the English developed it into a factorybase and the major commercial center of the west coast. On the other side of the peninsula, after planting themselves at Madras, the English moved north into the Bay of Bengal and the valley of the Hugli River. There, beginning in 1690, they built their own commercial city on the territory of a tiny village called Calcutta. The key was the purchase in 1698 of a kind of "feudal" privilege (zamindari rights of tax collection). These rights, though flouted at first by local authorities resentful of European intrusion, were increasingly honored as Indian merchants and officials came to depend on English trade, assistance, and goodwill.2 In all of this, the name of the game was buying interested friendship and collaboration. Begin with the big merchants and the courtiers of the Great Moghul. Go on to local agents and feudatories

The Dutch also tried to play this game in India, but fell short of English success. For the Dutch, Indonesia had priority, and India got the leavings of their attention and resources. In the islands, Dutch firepower extruded competitors, made violence easier. They got off on their strong foot, and the aggressive temperament of such proconsuls as Coen set the pattern. Dutch preferences also reflected material opportunities. They aimed at monopoly in Indonesia, against the interest of the locals. That was not feasible in India, where home rulers were stronger and where other players, already established, disputed the marketplace. Yet all businessmen prefer monopoly to competition

In India the English learned that Asia had more and better to trade than spices. In particular, India produced the world's finest cotton yarn and textiles, and the English were quick to seize the opportunity. Here they left their rivals behind. The Portuguese had shown litde interest in these products, and even the Dutch were slow to catch on. But the East India Company (EIC) decided to push cotton fabrics and make a market: "calicoes are a commodity whereof the use is not generally known, the vent must be forced and trial made into all ports."6 This vent had traditionally been directed toward regional buyers in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, who exchanged spices and other local goods for Indian cloth. Like the Dutch, the English continued this pattern, for they had litde of their own to sell and cottons thus furnished vital means of payment. (England's woolens had litde appeal in climates where the problem was to stay cool rather than keep warm.) But the EIC's momentous innovation lay in introducing these cottons to Europe. In 1619-21 the V O C was shipping some 12,000 pieces of calico to the Netherlands; the E I C was up to 221,500 pieces by 1625. Then, after a slow period of digestion and retrenchment, the trade took off toward the end of the century: some 200,000 pieces a year in the late 1660s; 578,000 in the 1670s; 707,000 in the 1680s. The Dutch followed suit, but remained at half or less of English levels.7 Indian cottons transformed the dress of Europe and its overseas offshoots. Lighter and cheaper than woolens, more decorative (by dyeing or printing), easier to clean and change, cotton was made for a new wide world. Even in cold climes, the suitability of cotton for underwear transformed the standards of cleanliness, comfort, and health. In the American plantations, it answered perfectiy; as some Jamaica traders put it (1704): " . . . the said island being situated in a hot climate, much of the clothing of the inhabitants is stained callicoes, which being light and cheap and capable of often washing contributes very much to the keeping them clean and in health."8 Here was a commodity of such broad and elastic demand that it could drive an industrial revolution

silk (from Bengal), indigo, and saltpeter;* also pepper, while conceding the cosdier, rarer spices to the Dutch. But pepper, once the lodestone of European exploration and expansion, was in decline. New areas of cultivation had opened up; supply exceeded demand. The price of pepper sank so far that this once noble spice had to earn its way to Europe as ballast on certain routes.** India led to China. When Europeans entered the Indian Ocean, they found a flourishing network of trade linking Asia from east to west, from China, Japan, and the Philippines to the caravan stations and ports of the Levant and East Africa. The intruders forced their way in. In the eighteenth century, European appetite for Chinese goods grew rapidly: porcelains, which Europe did not learn to manufacture until the 1720s; raw silk; and tea, an addictive substance complementary to West Indian sugar. These purchases posed a payments problem. The Europeans would have liked to pay with their own manufactures, but the Chinese wanted almost nothing they made (clocks and watches were a great exception). So the Europeans paid in bullion and specie, but that only shifted the problem: what could they sell for Spanish silver, Japanese or Brazilian gold? Not easy. The answer, of course, was to find something the Chinese wanted. This turned out to be opium, grown in Bengal and market-making as well as habit-forming. Here the British had a big advantage over the Dutch. In principle the traders of both nations had the right to compete for this commodity, but the British used their growing political power in the region to squeeze the Dutch out—a major blow

India, next to China, was the most populous country in Asia. We have no censuses, but one estimate gives the figure of 100 million for the late sixteenth century, and this may well be low.9 India possessed large fertile territories, notably the great river valleys of the northern plains—the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra—and was far from densely settled. One Indian scholar describes it as land-abundant and assumes that in the seventeenth century, it was still able to confine agriculture to the most productive areas; also to profit from pasture and waste to keep large numbers of livestock.1 0 (On the other hand, India got far less from its cattle than it might have, even less than nothing, because of religious taboos.) India also—far more than Indonesia—had a large and skilled industrial workforce, whose products circulated throughout the region. As a result, the Indian economy yielded a substantial surplus that supported rulers and courts of legendary opulence: The annual revenues of the Mogul emperor Aurangzeb (1658-1701) are said to have amounted to $450,000,000, more than ten times those of [his contemporary] Louis XTV. According to an estimate of 1638, the Mogul court of India is supposed to have accumulated a treasure equivalent to one and one-half billion dollars.1 1 India's reputation for wealth in palaces and temples attracted one invader after another—in particular, Turkic nomads, horse-mounted warriors, who rode from the plains of central Asia to plunder the sedentary societies on their periphery. The last of these Turkic rulers of India were Moghuls (Mughals), the dynasty of Babar (1483-1530), a descendant of the terrifying Timur (Tamerlane), driver of human cattle, heaper of skulls. It was Babar's grandson Akbar (reigned 1556-1605) and greatgrandson Jahangir (reigned 1605-27) whom the English found on the throne when they first came to India.

The Moghuls, of course, held the land as a despotic occupier and commanded no loyalty. Their rule was repeatedly challenged by the indigenous Hindu states and subverted by rebellions and palace conspiracies. Brothers killed brothers; children, fathers; fathers, children.

The tyranny of these Muslim rulers—no better or worse than that of Hindu despots—was aggravated by the measures taken to prevent sedition. This is a classic problem of autocracies: how to prevent lieutenants from taking root and creating rival centers of power. In medieval Europe, the grant of landed fiefs was originally personal, not heritable, but over time local lords tended to stay put and pass domains down to their heirs, bonding with the landed elites of the area and creating the fragmented authority we know as feudalism. In Moghul India, as in other Turkic states, agents of the ruler were moved about. This limited local power, but also destroyed the official's commitment to his territory. His aim became to make and take as much as possible as fast as possible, spending litde on social capital.1 3 All take and no give. In those regions dependent on irrigation, this neglect of communal equipment could be disastrous, as the annals of Indian famines testify

the peasant (and indeed all subjects) had no reason to improve the land, holding it as he did at the pleasure of the ruler. There is in this country, wrote François Bernier, a French physician who spent a dozen years in India in the seventeenth century, no mien et tien (no mine and yours), that is, no right or sense of property. N o one, he wrote, dares to show his wealth, for fear of extortion or seizure. N o one cares to improve ways or tools of production. Hence, wrote Bernier, the appalling contrast between the opulent few and the impoverished many; the decrepitude of the houses; the humiliation of the mass; the absence of incentives to learning and self-improvement. Hence also severe constraints on credit and on the commercial possibilities that credit makes possible. Much has been made of the beehive of trade in the Indian ocean when the Europeans arrived;1 4 also of the wealth of the sarafs, who lent at high rates to peasants and merchants alike. But high rates mean high risk. What security could the borrower offer? How much can a lender afford to lend when the need to hide assets severely reduces information?1 5 India's commercial activity languished well below its potential

one scholar estimates India's surplus at half the agricultural product. This "bundle" was bound to turn the East India Company toward political as against commercial activity, for more money could be had by taking than by earning. Endemic conflict and violence, moreover, incited (compelled) the company to look to its defenses by mobilizing military power, and power encouraged intervention in local disputes.

The EIC was ready to let others into the Indian market—except perhaps the French, who chose to challenge them politically. Still, the EIC's power and privilege gave it a decisive advantage in an ostensibly level field. Employees of the company were quick to seize the opportunity, not only trading on their own account but lending their name and virtual authority to native servants and business associates ready to pay for the favor. In a world of Muslim pride and xenophobia, this British assertion brought humiliation high and low, for the turnpike man at the customs station as much as for the prince in his palace. These infidel pretensions undermined the dignity and legitimacy of the viceroyal authorities and led to war between the Nawab of Bengal and the company; and war will always provide grounds for grievance and hate. So here: the young prince Suraj-ud-Dowlah (Sirajuddaullah) decided to teach the British a lesson and in 1756 took Calcutta against the merest shadow of resistance. He then perpetrated "that great crime, memorable for its singular atrocity, memorable for the tremendous retribution by which it was followed."1 7 This was the massacre of the "Black Hole," a chamber 18 by 15 feet with only two small, barred windows. Into this box the nawab's men jammed one hundred forty-six prisoners on a steamystifling June night—civilians as well as soldiers, including a few women. Pleas and protests went up, but the nawab had retired to sleep and could not to be disturbed. The cries ebbed. In the morning only twenty-three prisoners were still alive. The crime demanded reprisal, and local representatives of John Company were only too pleased to have a go at it.1 8 As soon as a fleet could be armed, it sailed up from Madras with a small detachment of British and sepoy troops under the command of Robert Clive, a young civil servant of the company, a desk man with a genius for war. Because of adverse winds, the ships took some two months to sail up the Bay of Bengal and enter the Hugli River. There the British easily recaptured Calcutta, imposed a huge indemnity on ud-Dowlah, and compelled restoration of all company privileges. For the nawab, an expensive night's sleep. But that was not the end of the story. The war in Europe between Britain and France had its echo in Bengal, where the nawab courted the French for the best of reasons—revenge and the opportunity to escape from his engagements. Another Moghul miscalculation. Apprised of these maneuvers, the British under Clive attacked and captured the French trading station at Chandernagore (Chandarnagar

How glorious it would be for the Company to have a Nabob devoted to them!"—they found Mir Jafar, the nawab's uncle by marriage and a commander of his armed forces.1 9 Local officials and traders were there to be bought and sold, crossed and double-crossed. Using a shrewd Hindu merchant named Omichund (Umichand or Amin Chand) as intermediary, the British bought Mir Jafar's treason with the promise to name him nawab. Mir Jafar in turn committed himself to pay an elephantine fortune for his elevation. In the end, on 23 June 1757, the issue came down to a battle, at Plassey (Placis, Palasi), a village ninety miles north of Calcutta—British and allies on one side, nawab and minions on the other. The British won, and winning, changed Indian history. The bards of imperial greatness sing of Robert Clive, accountant-turned-commander. They tell of generalship and treason and small but decisive precautions—like covering the guns in a monsoon rain. The anti-imperialist iconoclasts dismiss narrative, play down heroism (everyone is brave), and deplore the readiness of local officials and magnates to be bought, their want of loyalty.2 0 But, of course, that is the Achilles heel of aristocratic empires like the Moghul and its parts: What loyalty? The nawab began the battle with fifty thousand troops, against three thousand for the British. Of the fifty thousand, only twelve thousand actually fought for him, and these withdrew so quickly that they suffered only five hundred casualties. British losses numbered four Europeans and fourteen sepoys. And this was one of history's decisive battles

how have East India Company records survived in Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta? Was there a crucial difference in forms of commercial organization? Chartered companies depended on an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus, and bureaucracy means paper. Perhaps the problem is one of continuity and custodianship. The Indian political units were ephemeral, and their papers with them. Perhaps they should have written on clay tablets or stone. One thing is clear: the Europeans of that day were already interested in records. Mark here the difference between hieratically literate and generally literate societies. The Europeans, for all the analphabetism of the populace, were of the latter category. From middling on up, they read, but also wrote and published—not only the officials but private citizens. The nearest equivalents in the nonEuropean world would be the Japanese and the Jews. Europeans also were passionately curious about other peoples and societies: the overwhelming majority of travel accounts of that day were written by and for them. This curiosity quotient was an important and characteristic aspect of European expansion and dominion. Whether deliberate or unconscious (and it was both)

In recent years, anticolonialist critics have made much of the alleged misdeeds of Western curiosity, putting scholars, spies, and diplomatic agents in the same knaves' basket. The best known elaboration of these charges is Edward Said's much-discussed Orientalism (1978). (More on this powerful and influential book in chapter 24, pp. 415-18.) Insofar as the critique holds that only insiders can know the truth about their societies, it is wrong. Insofar as one uses this claim to discredit the work of intellectual adversaries, it is polemical and antiscientific. But insofar as it points to the instrumental value and power of information, for good and for bad, it makes an important point

The Indian economy changed and grew as new technologies, the railway in particular, came in from abroad. But it was slow to respond to the Industrial Revolution, except as supplier of raw cotton; and the Indian cotton manufacture, once the world's greatest, shrank almost to vanishing. Indian historians blame this on their colonial oppressor, who not only vetoed protective tariffs (long live free trade!) but taxed the Indian product to equalize access for British yarn and cloth. But that was not the problem. Both Indian and British entrepreneurs were free to undertake modern forms of manufacture in India, as they did beginning in the 1850s. If they refrained earlier, they presumably had good reason.

Some of the most important work on Indian history has been done by Indian scholars, yet these, ironically, have had to rely almost exclusively on European records and accounts. Almost no written documentation comes down to us from the Indian side.

Omichund, the historian Macaulay tells us with the candor of an age that did not know political correctness, was well equipped by his business experience to mediate between the English and the nawab's court. "He possessed great influence with his own race, and had in large measure the Hindoo talents, quick observation, tact, dexterity, perseverance, and the Hindoo vices, servility, greediness, and treachery." It was Omichund's task to lull and gull the nawab. This he did. Thanks to his inventions and fictions, the planning proceeded apace; but the more it advanced, the more everything depended on the discretion of Omichund. A word from him could destroy the conspiracy. And just at this point Clive began to hear disquieting news, that Omichund was hinting at betrayal unless he got a huge compensation. Huge? He asked for 300,000 pounds sterling (say 150 million of today's dollars), and what's more, he wanted this commitment written into the treaty that would seal the installation of Mir Jafar on the throne of Bengal. Clive was outraged. This was blatant dishonesty. It was also greedy. He decided to repay cross with double cross and had two treaties drawn up—one real, on white paper, making no mention of Omichund; the other false, on red paper, with a clause in the merchant's favor. Not all Englishmen were ready to connive at this fraud: Admiral Watson refused to sign the red version, an omission that would surely arouse Omichund's suspicions. So Clive—as much be hanged for a cow as a sheep—forged the admiral's signature. Now it was time for action. The confident nawab took up arms. Clive and his English troops—the kind of men, as he put it, who had never turned their back—routed him at Plassey (1757). The nawab fled the field and then his throne. The winners met to divide the spoils. Omichund came to the conference full of expectation, for Clive had treated him up to the last minute with unfailing consideration. The white treaty was then read. N o mention of Omichund. Turning to Clive, he had his answer: "The red treaty is a trick. You are to receive nothing." The poor man swooned, was revived, but never regained his senses. Gradually he sank into lethargy and bewilderment. Once a man of sharp reasoning and simple dress, he now walked pointiessly about in lavish, bejeweled accouterments. Within a few months he was dead

The point was that Clive had committed "not merely a crime, but a blunder." Individuals, Macaulay points out, may get rich by perfidy, but not states. In the public domain, a reputation for veracity is worth more than valor and intelligence, and this especially in a world of ubiquitous guile and duplicity. Nothing other than a reputation for unconditional honesty could have enabled Britain to maintain its empire in India at so litde expense; nothing else could have brought out the wealth of the nation from its hiding and hoarding places. The mightiest princes of the East, he notes, cannot persuade their subjects to part with their wealth for usurious returns; the British can bring forth tens of millions of rupees at 4 percent. This is Macaulay's judgment. He has a point. But were Clive's successors more scrupulous than he? Or have imperialists and statesmen simply learned to lie better? Or to lie in some things and not in others? Pursue honesty in money matters, and Devil take the rest? That would be an irony. The fact is that even in Macaulay's righteous time, veracity was a function of raison d'état. Even in money matters—especially in money matters. It is true that investors trusted the word of Britain and bought consols at 4 percent, and Britain never let them down . . . until the twentieth century, when war and deficits undermined the purchasing power of the pound and killed the gold standard. Is inflation a kind of impersonal lie?

Once the Spanish conquistadors found the mainland empires with their treasures and people, they lost interest in the Caribbean. They stayed long enough in those islands to sweep up what gold they could, whether accumulated ornaments or placer tailings, and wiped out most of the natives in the process. They needed food and found the local starch staple, manioc, noxious and inedible.* Grain cultivation never entered their mind: the Indians were wanted for mining, and the Spanish had not come to be farmers. So they imported food from Europe—very expensive—and brought in cattle to pasture where men had once hunted and fished. In those early years, the conquistadors went hungry; "on the edge of famine," says Pierre Chaunu. In the next stage they became the biggest meat eaters in history.

retrospect, the Spanish passion for gold was a big mistake. The islands were there for the using, and Spain's failure was Europe's opportunity. Columbus had understood. When he did not find the gold he had hoped for, he wrote his sovereigns that these islands were made for sugar. At the time, he was trying to hold their interest, to justify his voyage. And he was right. Columbus had learned about sugar cane in the Madeiras and Canaries. He was in effect recommending the continuation of a plant migration, and the agriculture that went with it, that had begun centuries before in South Asia and was as much driven by soil exhaustion as drawn by consumer demand

The sugar leap from the African-Atiantic islands to the New World came not with the Spanish but with the Portuguese, who early on planted cane in Brazil, and the Dutch, who served as merchants, refiners,2 and financiers of the Brazilian crop. The Dutch seized the northeast coast (Pernambuco) for some years (1630-43) during the period of Luso-Hispanic union, and learned about soil and cane; even before they were expelled, they were looking for fresh cane fields. This search turned them north to the nearest weak point in the enemy armor, the Lesser Antilles. There they seized a few islands (Aruba, St. Martin, Curaçao, Santa Lucia), "mere crumbs of land." They also planted themselves on the South American mainland (Surinam), where they established a few plantations on virgin soil. These did poorly. The Dutch proved better at moving sugar and slaves than growing the one and working the other

Upwind and well to the east of the other Antilles, it was rarely visited by either Caribs or Spanish. Jamaica, far bigger than any of these, came later (1655). It had been turned over by the Spanish crown to eight noble families, who were unwilling to share it and unable to develop it; so that when the English took the island, whites and blacks together counted no more than 3,000.3 In fact, Jamaica was a hellhole of sandflies, gnats, cockroaches, and malarial mosquitoes; but then, bugs were everywhere in the Caribbean, either too big to be believed or too small to be seen. Even the smallest were maddeningly audible and excruciatingly venomous. Gendefolk put the legs of their tables and beds in bowls of water to keep the crawlers grounded

the slave trade was only part of a larger complex—what used to be known as the triangular trade(s) and is now called the Atiantic system. Slave labor made high-intensity sugar cultivation and refining possible. The sugar (and such derivatives as rum and molasses) generated in turn its own profits, nourishing both planters and the merchants who sold the sugar and financed the plantations, while providing tea and coffee drinkers and other caffeine addicts with the illusion of nourishment.1 9 The planters in turn bought food for themselves and their slaves (because they were unwilling to sacrifice to food cropland that could be used for cane). Some of this food came from Europe; an increasing proportion from the settler colonies of North America. They also bought manufactures: cheap cotton textiles and high-fashion silks; copper vessels for boiling shed and still; iron, nails, guns; and machines and parts for the mill. Meanwhile British producers were turning out trade goods to exchange for slaves in Africa. All of this was a whole, and slavery a crucial part. The effect was to stimulate both agriculture and industry, increase wages and incomes in Britain, promote the division of labor, and encourage the invention of labor-saving devices.2 0 From this holistic perspective one does not have to rest the argument (for the importance of slavery to industrialization) on the profits (not nearly so great as popularly believed) and spending of those who bought, sold, and used slaves. To be sure, much of this money did accrue to Britain, and some of it found its way indirectly into manufacturing. Yet it constituted a minor addition to industrial capital. Absentee planters tended to put their fortunes into land, status, and country living. (Their incomes also suffered badly by their absence from production and management.) Merchants were another matter, and some of them did invest in industry; but they were the exception among merchants and more so among industrialists

the increase in the size of the market made a difference. (We are not talking profit here but volume.) Africans and Americans wanted products made by repetitious techniques that lent themselves to mechanization. Take cotton. An infant industry at the beginning of the eighteenth century, British cotton was inadvertendy protected by the so-called calico arts, directed against Indian goods; and although it was still far behind wool in the middle of the century when inventors first tried to mechanize spinning, it was much bigger than before and rising fast, in part on the strength of sales to the plantations. So, when wool proved difficult, the inventors tried cotton; and they succeeded

The Spanish were never important players in the sugar trade. They had quicker ways to get rich, and when they did turn to sugar, they saw it essentially as a material basis of status and lifestyle. They never understood, as the English planters did, the advantages of specialization and division of labor, of the integration of sugar plantations as production units into a larger economic system

Portugal is a small country of moderate fertility. In the fifteenth century its population numbered about 1 million and its chief products and exports consisted of wine (port and, increasingly, madeira—rich, head-turning beverages) and, rising fast, cane sugar. Had the Portuguese of that era been able to anticipate the now classical analysis of comparative advantage by David Ricardo, they would have continued on this sensible path, minding their own business and trading their natural produce for the manufactures of other lands. Instead, they jumped the traces of rationality and turned their land into a platform for empire. Portugal's far-flung network of dominion would come to stretch three quarters of the way around the world, from Brazil in the west to the Spice Islands and Japan in the Far East. Such a leap beyond sense and sensibility is not unknown in history. We shall see several examples later on; and indeed it is precisely this kind of unreasonable initiative that endows history with uncertainty and defeats prediction. But the Portuguese expansion is particularly surprising, for Portugal had neither people nor means. Its population was too small to send large numbers abroad; indeed one reason why Portugal was so quick and eager to import slaves from Africa was to make up for labor scarcity at home

its ability to build and arm oceangoing vessels, were limited. This was a lightweight going up against heavies. The Portuguese achievement testifies to their enterprise and toughness; to their religious faith and enthusiasm; to their ability to mobilize and exploit the latest knowledge and techniques. N o silly chauvinism; pragmatism first. They drew in outsiders for their money, know-how, and labor; used slaves as workers and occasionally as fighters; married women of every race and more than one at a time. They had no room for Portuguese women on these long voyages, although sometimes they sent out a few orphans, who could not say no. Like the men, these few white women did not do well in pestilential climes: childbirth, for example, was typically a death sentence for both mother and babe. Miscegenation worked better: the men bought and enjoyed female slaves of color by the dozen—as though to beget a new nation from their loins. Their one emotional outiay was piety. The Portuguese took priests and friars with them on every vessel, for their own safety and salvation (the power of prayer and sacrament); for the propagation of the faith among infidels and pagans; and as salve to their own conscience. These men of God legitimated and sanctified greed. Religious commitment entailed a serious commercial disadvantage: it introduced an element of irreconcilability into what might have been an easier, more profitable encounter. For the Portuguese, the Muslims were infidels and enemies of the true faith. N o brutality was too much. All Muslim shipping was fair game; all Muslim kingdoms were defined as foes. On his second voyage of 1502, Vasco da Gama capped a victory over a Muslim flotilla before Calicut by cutting off the ears, noses, and hands of some eight hundred "Moors" and sending them ashore to the local ruler with the facetious suggestion that he make curry of them. And one of his captains, his maternal uncle Vincente Sodre (whose name deserves to be remembered ad opprobrium), flogged the chief Muslim merchant at Cannanore (Malabar coast) until he fainted, then stuffed his mouth with excrement and covered it with a slab of pork to make sure he ate the filth.1 Such actions led to war with the many lands bordering the Indian Ocean: East Africa, Arabia and Persia, much of India, the greater part of the Indonesian archipelago.

Portuguese political strategy necessarily diverged sharply from the opportunistic Spanish conquests. For one thing, the locals were far more numerous, and their familiarity with metal and war made them serious adversaries. For another, they were not vulnerable to Portuguese-imported diseases. On the contrary, the Portuguese had cause to fear local contagion and parasites. As a result, they had to limit their craving so as not to dissipate their forces. The Portuguese looked for choice places of strategic import, key points controlling key passages—Malindi and Mombasa on the African coast (jump-off points for voyages to India), Ormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, Malacca (between Sumatra and Malaysia, on the strait connecting the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Ceylon to the South China Sea and the Spice Islands), Macao near the mouth of the Pearl River (entry to southeast China). They wanted Aden (access to the Red Sea), but could never take it. The most important base of all was Goa, pearl of the Malabar coast—entrepôt for pepper, port of entry for Arabian horses into South India (the climate made it impracticable to breed horses locally), defended by sea and, on the landward side, by a channel stocked with crocodiles. In the end, the native rulers of these regions learned to live and do business with these Portuguese enclaves, as they had with other outsiders since time immemorial. When they did attack Europeans, they were thwarted as often as not by their own local enemies. The Portuguese played the balance of power to a fare-thee-well, and it saved them more than once.

Everything changed once the Dutch and English entered the arena. In 1605, the Dutch took Amboina and drove the Portuguese from other bases in the Moluccas (Spice Islands). In 1622, the Portuguese lost Ormuz to the Persians, who were decisively assisted by English ships and gunners. In 1638, the Dutch took Elmina, that first Portuguese fort on the Guinea coast, symbol of their pioneer voyages and market for African gold and slaves. In 1641, it was Malacca's turn, again to the Dutch; in 1665-67, Macassar's. In the course of all this, the Dutch simply threw the Portuguese out of the Spice Islands, the original point of the exercise. Portugal's day had come and gone, but pride thrives on reverses, and they clung to what they could. Thus they held Goa until 1961 (long after it had lost wealth and commercial importance)

Portugal's primary commercial objective in the East was to obtain pepper and other spices and ship these directly to Europe, bypassing the intermediaries that encumbered the traditional traffic across Asia and into the Mediterranean.* This the Portuguese did by purchase or seizure, compensating by force for the obstacles that Muslim merchants put in their way. In the early decades, these measures garnered a large share of the trade. At the peak, some 40 percent of the pepper imported into Europe was going around the Cape of Good Hope, and the Venetians were hurting. But with time, the older trade routes reasserted themselves. The direct Portuguese share fell back to about 20 percent, still important but no longer dominant. In 1570, the Portuguese crown gave up its monopoly of the trade between Lisbon and the east (Goa). The king ceased to be a merchant and instead sold concessions, frequently to foreign traders. In 1586, the German merchant house of Welser leased the exclusive rights to purchase pepper in the Indies. The sale marked ebbtide. The Portuguese were selling an empty hand

We have no aggregate data.4 But we do know that Venice, drawing on overland shipments to the Levant, once again found itself Europe's key pepper emporium in the latter part of the sixteenth century. When the news came of the first successful Dutch voyages to the East Indies [Cornells Houtman, 1595], Venice, as well as Portugal, could see the imminent, "utter overthrow" of the older trade.5 By 1625, the Venetian customs classified spices as "western commodities": they now came from the Atlantic rather than the Near East.) To make up for the shrinking spice trade, the Portuguese got into intra-Asian exchange. This had flourished well before the Europeans came: Gujrati, Javanese, and Chinese merchants trading pepper and spices for Indian and Chinese textiles and Chinese porcelain; Arab merchants walking and shipping slaves from Africa throughout the Mus

lim world; ships from everywhere moving teak, sandalwood, and other fine woods; ivory and rhinoceros horn, valued as an aphrodisiac; also rare and not-so-rare animals, including monkeys, tigers, and above all horses and elephants, for use in war and ceremony; and everyone bringing precious metals to balance accounts (silver from the New World to India and China, gold from East Africa and Japan). Much of this Asian trade was spontaneous and improvisational—a kind of Brownian movement. One went where the cargoes were, bouncing from port to port. This is the way of what later came to be known as tramp steamers; these were tramp sailing ships.

Along with this went a shift out of trade into what the economist would call rent-seeking activities. In particular, the Portuguese sought to use their power to batten on the trade of others. They became the robber barons of the Indian Ocean. All merchant vessels were required to purchase a Portuguese trading license. Those that did not were liable to seizure. The shift to racketeering and local trade made possible important economies: many fewer ships went out from Europe to Asia. In their stead, the Portuguese used Indian-built vessels. Hardwood was readily available, and Indian carpenters quickly learned to work to European specifications—and for much lower wages. Crews also went native. Sometimes, except for fifteen or twenty European (or Eurasian) soldiers, gunners, and officers, the entire ship's complement would be Asians or African slaves. Given the size of the Indian Ocean, one might have thought the need for patrol ships endless, to ensure obedience to Portuguese controls. Here the topography helped: the narrow trade routes and passages made for easy surveillance. Besides, one did not have to be everywhere; a few exemplary boardings and seizures made the point. The trouble is, two and more can play the game. The European newcomers fought harder and sailed better. Accounts of early Dutch and English voyages to the area (early seventeenth century) are full of waiting and skulking, of traps and perfidy, of attacks and captures. One side's knave was another's hero. James Lancaster, a bold and skillful English captain, could not get enough by trade on his second voyage to the Indies (1601)? N o problem. When Lancaster returned to England two years later, his ships laden with booty, King James knighted him for his efforts. The surface of the Indian Ocean mimicked the waters below, full of predators feeding on one another. All of this amounted to legalized piracy, legitimized for the Dutch and English by a state of war with Spain, which war extended to Portugal once the two Iberian kingdoms were joined in 1580 by common rule

even after the two Iberian kingdoms separated in 1640, the Dutch and English were loath to return to peace. What could be better than The good old rule, the simple plan, That they should take who have the power, And they should keep who can T The land powers of the Indies watched this intra-European contest and kept clear. They preferred to take their share of monopolistic trade or even to use the foreigner as an ally in their own wars. Besides, the Asians were largely indifferent to maritime power and naval prowess— "Wars by sea," said Bahadur Shah, ruler of Gujarat and neighbor of the Portuguese, "are merchants' affairs and of no concern to the prestige of kings." That was not far from the Chinese attitude. Another bad mistake

People of our day may wonder why pepper and other condiments were worth so much to Europeans of long ago. The reason lay in the problem of food preservation in a world of marginal subsistence. Food supply in the form of cereals barely sufficed, and it was not possible to devote large quantities of grain to animals during long winters, excepting of course breeding stock, draft animals, and horses. Hence the traditional autumnal slaughter. To keep this meat around the calendar, through hot and cold, in a world without artificial refrigeration, it was smoked, corned, spiced, and otherwise preserved; when cooked, the meat was heavily seasoned

Hence the paradox that the cuisine of warmer countries is typically "hotter" than that of colder lands—there is more to hide. Condiments brought a further dividend. The people of that day could not know this, but the stronger spices worked to kill or weaken the bacteria and viruses that promoted and fed on decay. Tabasco and other hot sauces, for instance, will render infected oysters safer for human consumption; at least they kill microorganisms in the test tube. Spices, then, were not merely a luxury in medieval Europe but also a necessity, as their market value testified

To understand the rise and fall of empires, one must always look as much at the forces and circumstances of the home country as at conditions in the field. When the Portuguese conquered the South Atlantic, they were in the van of navigational technique. A readiness to learn from foreign savants, many of them Jewish, had brought knowledge that translated directiy into application; and when, in 1492, the Spanish decided to compel their Jews to profess Christianity or leave, many found refuge in Portugal, then more relaxed in its anti-Jewish sentiments. But in 1497, pressure from the Roman Church and Spain led the Portuguese crown to abandon this tolerance. Some seventy thousand Jews were forced into a bogus but nevertheless sacramentally valid baptism. In 1506, Lisbon saw its first pogrom, which left two thousand "converted" Jews dead. (Spain had been doing as much for two hundred years.) From then on, the intellectual and scientific life of Portugal descended into an abyss of bigotry, fanaticism, and purity of blood

in matters of intolerance, the persecutor's greatest loss is self-inflicted. It is this process of self-diminution that gives persecution its durability, that makes it, not the event of the moment, or of the reign, but of lifetimes and centuries. By 1513, Portugal wanted for astronomers; by the 1520s, scientific leadership had gone. The country tried to create a new Christian astronomical and mathematical tradition but failed, not least because good astronomers found themselves suspected of Judaism.1 2 (Compare the suspicious response to doctors in Inquisition Spain.) As in Spain, the Portuguese did their best to close themselves off from foreign and heretical influences. Education was controlled by the Church, which maintained a medieval curriculum focused on grammar, rhetoric, and scholastic argument

no more Portuguese students went to study abroad, and the import of books was strenuously controlled by inspectors sent by the Holy Office to meet incoming ships and visit bookshops and libraries. An index of prohibited works was first prepared in 1547; successive expansions culminated in the huge list of 1624— the better to save Portuguese souls. Within the kingdom and overseas, a triple censorial barrier begrudged imprimaturs and discouraged originality. Such printing presses as were allowed (in Goa, none in Brazil) were in the hands of clerics, generally Jesuits, who limited their publications to dictionaries and religious matter. * From Brazil and Angola, even these safe materials had to be sent to Portugal for prior censorship

Portugal diplomats and agents abroad came back with the message that the rest of the world was moving on while Portugal stood still. These estrangeirados—their pejorative nickname—attracted deep suspicion, for they were tainted. Their dismissal was implicit in Portuguese pride. Most unfortunate. They saw what few Portuguese could or would see: that the pursuit of Christian uniformity was stupid; that the Holy Office of the Inquisition was a national disaster; that the Church was swallowing the wealth of the country; that the government's failure to promote agriculture and industry had reduced Portugal to the role of "the best and most profitable colony of England."1 4 (British classical economists would put it differendy.

Through this self-imposed closure, the Portuguese lost competence even in those areas they had once dominated. "From being leaders in the van of navigational theory and practice, [they] dropped to being stragglers in the rear."1 6 By the end of the seventeenth century, several of the pilots in the carreira da India (the Indian trade) were foreigners. Gone the days of top-secret navigational charts; the Dutch had better ones. And when the chief engineer persuaded King John (Joào) V (reigned 1706-50) to renew the teaching of mathematics, military engineering, and astronomy, the instruments required came from abroad

As countries go , Holland is small—almost as small as Portugal, . and hardly big enough to play the grand imperialist. In 1500, the Dutch numbered about 1 million; 150 years later, twice that. Small, but potent: in the seventeenth century, half the people lived in cities, a higher percentage than anywhere else in Europe. And active: an observer of 1627 noted that Dutch roads and waterways were crowded, "that there are not so many carriages (and heaven knows there are) in Rome than there are wagons here, filled with travelers, while the canals, which crisscross the country in all directions, are covered by innumerable boats."2 Even more impressive were the ports large and small, hives of shipping. By the 1560s the province of Holland alone possessed some one thousand eight hundred seagoing ships—six times those floated by Venice at the height of its prosperity a century earlier. About five hundred of these were attached to Amsterdam

In the early seventeenth century, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, also became king of Spain through the marriage of his father Philip to Juana, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Charles brought along in his basket of tides and sovereignties the duchy of Burgundy (fruit of another happy alliance). Burgundy, in turn, held sway over the Low Countries. In this roundabout way, one of the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan areas of Europe—hub of industry, trade, and ideas, long free of seigneurial servitudes and accustomed to economic, intellectual, and spiritual diversity—got tied to the short leash of the Spanish Habsburgs. One source of irreconcilable conflict: the ruler of Spain, bound by his country's past, could never tolerate open Protestant worship in his dominions.5 It is an irony of history that Dutch and Spanish should do battle. The Low Countries (north and south) had better things to do. These doughty burghers, seamen, fishers, and peasants had become the middlemen of northern Europe. They imported and reexported the primary products of the North Sea, Scandinavia, and eastern Europe: grain, timber, fish, tallow, tar, hides. They manufactured woolen and mixed fabrics and were masters of commercial credit and international finance. Antwerp, great port on the Scheldt, dominated the new maritime economy. It linked an enormous European hinterland to the Atlantic and beyond, sweeping past older centers such as Venice and Genoa to become the ultimate destination of cargoes from new worlds overseas. These might stop first in Lisbon and Seville, but they finished in the Netherlands, there to be absorbed, processed, and redistributed throughout the world.

in the realm of belief, two things sharpened the conflict and shaped the fate of this region. First fanaticism and intolerance triumphed in Spain, leading in 1492 to the expulsion of the Jews (later on to a similar expulsion of Muslims). Many of the Jews sought peace and dignity in the Low Countries, which had a reputation for tolerance. The second great religious event was the rise of Protestant Christianity as a system of organized worship and belief. Dissent and heresy were an old story, but in 1517, when Martin Luther nailed his "Ninetyfive Theses" to the church door in Wittenberg, he struck the first blow for secession. Christendom was headed for breakup. In the decades that followed, Protestants in several countries (the English Lollards had preceded them) translated the Bible into the vernacular. People read and started thinking for themselves, and laymen joined divines in rebellion. Among the areas that took smartly to the new dispensations: the Low Countries, particularly the northern provinces, where dissenters had long been indulged in matters of personal conscience. So it was that when Spanish administrators and clerics went north, they found a spiritual diversity and anarchy long since uprooted in Spain. Intolerable. Their response was to punish and suppress, in the face of outrage and against an abundance of good advice. After all, right is right, and one must not sacrifice God to Mammon (except of course in colonial areas). So the Spanish brought in the spies and thought police and soldiery

In return the intruders took some important cities—Antwerp and Ghent among them—and put them to the sack in the time-honored mode of sixteenth-century warfare.

when Spain virtually annexed Portugal and closed the ports of Seville and Lisbon to Dutch vessels in 1585, it forced these sober fladanders to become fighting seamen in alien seas. The Hollanders learned by espionage. The key figures were Cornells de Houtman, seaman and captain, and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, clerk, traveler, and geographer. Both men spent some years in Portuguese service, because the Portuguese needed all the help they could get and did not understand that Dutchmen were a security risk. When our expatriates returned to Holland, they brought precious information about eastern lands and seas: the shores, rocks, and reefs; the islands and harbors; the routes, winds, and currents; seasonal storms and calms; latitudes and compass bearings; the birds that fly and signal the land; the friends and enemies; the strengths and weaknesses of the Portuguese. Then the Dutch set sail. A half-dozen ships went out and came back, some empty, some laden. The main point—it could be done. A halfdozen companies, then four more, were formed, all determined to take the spices and treasures of the Indies

strength. So was born in 1602 the Vereenigde Oost-indische Compagnie (VOC), alias Jan Compagnie. The Dutch set out to make money by commerce. They found a world where trade was bound to force. N o spice could be bought without the benevolence of the local ruler or his agent, who had his own living to worry about. N o buy was sure: local rulers would sell the same crop twice. The political rivalries of the region were complex and ephemeral—Muslims vs. infidels, petty chiefs who would be king or sultan, loyalists vs. rebels, with the one becoming the other and then back again. And all of this was complicated and exacerbated by the actions of other Europeans. The Portuguese, already installed, were ready to bribe, lie, steal, even kill to thwart the Dutch. Likewise the Spanish, coming in through their Philippine back door. And hot on their heels, the English, too few yet to compete for market or territory, but making up for numbers with seamanship and gunnery. Everyone in these Eastern waters was half bandit, including the local sea jackals who ambushed the small boats and still in our time prey on defenseless refugees.

A free, efficient market would have reduced profit margins per unit of merchandise, even while it increased the return to capital. But the V O C would not have liked that either. What Jan Compagnie wanted was to exclude competitors, impose prices in the Indies, and maintain wide differentials between buy and sell. There lay maximum profits. That was not business; that was power and its uses—what the economist calls rent-seeking. Besides, these men of the V O C were pragmatists. They cheered the prospect of peace with Spain in 1609—finally, after some eighty years of cold and hot war. The peace accord called for a division of turf on the basis of the status quo, and the company wanted to alter the status quo in anticipation. So the directors sent a fast yacht to the Indies to get the word to its agents ahead of the Spanish in the Philippines: Plant factories and agencies wherever possible, by way of posing a claim. Such aggressive spoor-planting was bound to invite clashes, but this was no time to be timid. The V O C wanted above all to establish itself in the Spice Islands, the world's only source of nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Delivered in India, these spices brought profits ten and fifteen times cost. "The Islands of Banda and the Moluccas are our main target. We recommend most strongly that you tie these islands to the Company, if not by treaty then by force!

Dutch attacks on the Portuguese (often in connivance with local Muslim rulers), of sallies into Spanish territory, of fights with the English, of pursuit of pirates and practice of piracy (one country's piracy is another's police), of punitive expeditions and preemptive strikes against local rulers, of promises and treaties, cross and double cross. Suffice it to say that the Dutch came to "own" the Moluccas (the Spice Islands) and Java while establishing an effective sphere of influence over the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. They also took Ceylon and Formosa (Taiwan) and planted factories along the east coast of India (Coromandel and as far north as Bengal). They did less well on the western side (Malabar)—too close to the Portuguese, who could still defend their own turf. The Dutch tried and failed to snatch Macao too, but eventually got permission (along with others) to trade at Canton; and in Japan they were the only Europeans allowed, on condition that they accept confinement to a tiny island in Nagasaki harbor and submit to condign humiliation.

From this experience of combat and commerce, the Dutch drew certain lessons: no one could be trusted, not even one's fellow Christians (they had good reason to know); and Asians in general and Muslims in particular were lying, thieving scoundrels. In return, other Europeans came to think of the Dutch as avaricious, sanctimonious hypocrites; while the Muslims and other natives were convinced by faith, fear, and contact that no stratagem was too duplicitous for such infidels as these. None of these stereotypes was wholly true or wholly false. Life and work in the Indies did not bring out the best in people. Besides, although the Asians could not know it, they rarely met the best of the Dutch. The V O C recruited to its lower ranks the dregs of Dutch and German society; at the higher levels, the company got the greediest of the greedy

The greater volume of Dutch business in the Indies was not the company's shipments to and from the Netherlands, but rather the so-called country trade, the movement of cargoes from one Asian point to another: cottons from Coromandel to Indonesia and China, silks from China, Tonkin, India, and Persia to Manila and on to New Spain (Mexico), bullion and specie from Japan and the Philippines (out of Mexico), tea and gold from China, coffee from Mocha and later Java, slaves from Arakan, Buton, and Bali. And so on. A host of middling and small ships and junks (the Chinese were very busy) tramped the eastern seas, going from port to port as supply and demand suggested. Along with these cargoes went the treasures, purchased and pilfered, that individual sailors carried in their sea chests or hung over gunwales on company and private vessels. These rascals lived like dogs and were treated like dogs (slaves got better care, because slaves were worth money).9 So they traded. Everyone on shipboard was a dealer, and captains and supercargoes had to defend their space from the trespass of private merchandise. They had their own saleables to move

; a junior merchant was ready to pay 3,500 florins to the Appointments Board for a post that paid 40 a month but yielded 40,000. In the end, the company began to tax its officers on their presumed gains, which only encouraged them to attend more assiduously to their own business. Small wonder that after the V O C ' s demise, its logo came to be read as Vergaan onder Corruptie (Perished by corruption).1 1 Even so, the company made money. It paid dividends that averaged 18 percent per year from the time of its founding. Most of the VOC's earnings came from its monopolies of agricultural products: spices from the Spice Islands to begin with; then rice from Java, because one could not allow these specialized islands to waste spice land on food; then coffee and sugar, which the company introduced into Java. (Coffee came originally from the Mocha area in the Arabian peninsula, but the Dutch did so well acclimating it in Java that they gave us a new generic term for the beverage.) The other profits came from purchases in the open market: porcelain, silks, and tea in China; silks and cotton in India; and so on.

in the long run the monopolies were precarious. To maintain them against native and outsiders required the use of force so expensive that only a sovereign with taxing power could hope to pay the bill.1 2 Inevitably, the V O C was led to substitute its own governance for that of native princes.

Coffee is another, more egregious example of what Adam Smith called "so perfectly destructive a system."1 6 Coffee was first brought to Holland in 1661, and from 1696 attempts were made to cultivate the coffee tree in Java. Native growers were paid some 10 stuiver a pound, and at that price took eagerly to the new crop. So the company, always on the alert for economies, reduced the price to 2.5 stuiver, whereupon the natives began cutting coffee trees down, even in the face of punishment. So the company introduced compulsory cultivation and delivery, while raising the price; but later, when pepper gained in value, the company told the growers to cut down the coffee trees and substitute pepper. In 1738 it was decided to reduce the area under coffee by half, and the next year the company fixed the purchase quota at 2.7 million pounds. But when it became clear that the Netherlands alone would take 6 million, the company raised its quota to 4 million—always playing it safe. Yet it paid the Javanese grower so little that in 1751, it was able to buy less than 1 million pounds. Coffee trees take four years to mature, and these alternate plantings and cuttings precluded a flexible, rational response to changing demand

Holland got caught up in war with England in 1781-84, and the V O C found it hard to move goods between the Low Countries and the Indies. It had to ask for moratoria on its debt while borrowing afresh. The state was now the company's only creditor (bankers knew better), and its fate was bound up with that of the United Provinces. Then came the French Revolution, which boosted radical politics in the Netherlands and set up a puppet Batavian Republic (1795), much less sympathetic to the big business interests of the old regime. When the renewal of war with Britain drove sales down by almost two thirds, the outcome was inevitable. The Dutch state took over the company—assets, debt, and empire. This empire remained; indeed, the governments of a restored Holland ( 1 8 1 4 - ) worked well into the nineteenth century to round it out. Costs of administration were covered by imposing delivery quotas on selected plantation crops (coffee, tea, sugar), and by lucrative monopolies of salt and opium. From 1870 on, the Dutch abandoned the plantation "Culture System," partly owing to the conviction that a free market would work better, pardy owing to a bad conscience about forced labor

The world had opened up, transforming European self-awareness. Who are we? Who are they? Theologians and moralists posed questions about the nature of the "savages" found in these distant lands and the appropriate way to deal with them. For artists, the New World provided a plethora of images and themes, not only in itself but also as part of the new oecumene. For cartographers, maps became ephemera, repeatedly redrawn to new information. The sea monsters and ornamental flourishes disappeared to make way for new landmasses of increasingly accurate shape. New land invites action. The rulers of Spain saw and held the prospect of a great empire. This had no obvious connection with the holy war of Christendom against Islam, but was nevertheless seen as an extension of divinely blessed and papally sanctioned crusade

Merchant venturers bought and fitted old ships, built new ones, hired crews from a hundred leagues around. In trouble? Start over across the water. Men-at-arms and freelance caballeros, roughnecks, rogues, and ruffians, came forward to seek or remake their fortune. These people cherished the legends and fables of "chivalric romance"—the comic books of that age—tales of Amazons, headless and cynocephalous monsters, or better yet, of El Dorado (the Man of Gold). The Amazon legend was a particular favorite, combining as it did the themes of female and male prowess. These woman warriors were reported everywhere, always beyond the next cordillera or on an island some days journey away. In one instance, they were said to be coming to Spain, ten thousand of them, to get themselves pregnant "by the men of our nation, whose reputation for gallantry is well established."* The very extravagance of these tales and promises made for credence. Anything and everything was possible in those distant lands. For a quarter of a century, the Spanish sailed about the Caribbean, touching the continents to south and north, always disappointed not to find the treasures that presumably lay just beyond the next landfall. They comforted themselves for the nonce with slaves, botanical novelties, exotic fauna, pieces of gold that hinted at mother lodes. Messengers went back to Spain with jewels and nuggets, by way of inducing the crown to send back reinforcements, animals, weapons. Meanwhile parties of conquistadors planted themselves, their flag, their cross; established "cities" in the legalistic tradition of the European commune and named them after divinities, saints, and sundry sacred objects; traded colored beads for gold pebbles; took part in native rivalries and played one tribe against another. They fought, terrorized, tortured, and killed the natives; bedded their wives, daughters, and Spanish-made relicts; and brought many a pagan soul to salvation, often at the same time as they extinguished the body. And always they asked after gold

Sailing along the coast of Yucatan in the second decade of the sixteenth century, the Spanish encountered Indians like none seen before. These were dressed in cotton garments and lived in towns built of stone. They did not know hard metal, neither bronze nor iron, but they had weapons—slings, poison darts, clubs set with razor-sharp pieces of obsidian—and they were not so easy to kill and intimidate as the islanders. So the Spanish spoke softer, traded and cajoled, and they learned of a land somewhere to the west, over the mountains, where ruled a great king, rich in ornament and glittering treasure. Each contact confirmed the promise, pardy because the ruler of this land, unbeknownst to the strangers, had given orders to appease them with gifts in the hope of inducing them to go away. This, needless to say, was a big mistake. Now party followed party northward and westward along the Mexican coast

the leader of the decisive exploratory flotilla was a man named Hernando Cortés—sometime rapscallion student in Salamanca, precocious and prodigious wencher with a weakness for the most dangerous kind of woman—another man's wife. Cortés had good reason to get out of Spain. He was handsome and virile, a charmer, intriguer, and diplomat, the kind of natural leader who would give his life for his men and whose men would follow him to hell. It took such a man to bring and hold together a band of a few hundred and with them (plus later reinforcements) conquer the mightiest power in North America. Even so, Cortés only begins the story. History is not a simple epic of derring-do. People matter, but the Aztec empire collapsed for deeper reasons. The most important lay in the very nature of tributary empires, which differ from kingdoms and nations by their ethnic diversity and want of sympathetic cohesion. The we/they division separates rulers from ruled and one member group from another; not members from outsiders. Such units are necessarily an expression of naked power. They rest on no deep loyalty; enjoy no real legitimacy; extort wealth by threat of pain. So, although they have the appearance of might, it is only appearance, and the replacement of one gang of tyrants by another is often welcomed by common folk who hope against hope that a change will relieve their oppression. In reality, the brilliance of these constructs is but glitter; their apparent hardness a brittle shell

When the Aztecs broke free, they fled into reedchoked fastnesses and sheltered there until they grew in numbers and strength. When they came out, originally because they needed drinkable water, they conquered one people after another, using a combination of art, prowess, and above all a terror that unstrung their adversaries and brought them to surrender before they were defeated.2 Aztec terror took the form of the industrialization of blood sacrifice. This is a touchy subject, which anthropologists and ideologues of indigmista have preferred to avoid or ignore, if not to excuse. Yet one cannot understand the strengths and weaknesses of the Aztec empire, its rise and fall, without dealing with this hate-provoking practice. Human sacrifice for religious purposes was general to the area (including Mayan lands to the south) and reflected a belief that the sun god in particular needed human blood for nourishment. Unfed, he might not rise again. Other gods also needed offerings: of babies and children, for example, to ensure the fertility of crops or an abundance of rain; the tears of the victims were a promise of water.3 Such symbolic gestures (perceived as acts of consubstantial nourishment) needed few victims. Adult flesh came primarily from capture in battle, and the victim was presented and told to think of himself as a hero in a noble cause: this is what we were born

tered and sprinkled on the idols, their bodies rolled down the steps and butchered to furnish culinary delicacies to the Aztec aristocracy. This last practice embarrasses politically correct ethnologists, who see in such descriptions of cannibalism a justification for foreign contempt and oppression.4 (It was certainly that for the conquistadors, who were disgusted when their Mexican hosts showed hospitality by saucing their guests' food with the blood of victims sacrificed right before their eyes.) Some have tried to argue that the whole business of cannibalism is a myth, a Spanish invention. Others, ready to concede the anthropophagy, have pointed to occasional Spanish lapses—as though measures of desperation are comparable to institutionalized behavior;5 or have tried to argue that this was the only way for the Aztecs (or at least the aristocracy, who had a quasi-monopoly of human flesh) to get enough protein in their diet. The best one can say for such nonsense, especially as applied to the privileged members of Aztec society, is that it shows imagination.* (Ironically enough, the Europeans would later find themselves accused of cannibalism by the Chinese, who preferred to think of foreigners as barbarians anyway.6 In China, such rumors served as a barrier to contact between natives and foreigners. In Africa, where cannibalism was not unknown, the Portuguese warned the locals against an alleged English appetite for human flesh, in the hope the natives would send these interlopers packing, or perhaps do worse. And the Chinese, undiscriminating in their superiority, said as much of the Portuguese. Barbarians are barbarians.

These mass sacrifices had precisely the effect desired by our Mexican Darth Vader: they sharply lowered Aztec enemies' will to resist. But the losers naturally nursed their hate. Aztec ceremonies also created a supply problem: where to get enough victims. In war? But that meant incessant fighting. In the prisons or among the slaves? But that meant an intensification of oppression and potential instability. With the connivance of the rulers of allied/subject peoples? This was the device of the so-called flower wars, where aristocratic collaborators from other nations watched behind flower screens as the Aztecs staged simulated

For all its seeming power and glory, then, the Aztec empire was a house of feathers. Detested for its tyranny and riven with dissension, it was already in breakup when the Spanish arrived.

Without this he could never have brought his small force up from the coast, guns and all, over the sierra, and into the valley of Mexico

By Aztec standards, the Spanish did not fight fair: they thrust at the body rather than at arms and legs, because a belly wound stopped an opponent if it did not kill him outright. The Aztec tactic of crowding round and smothering the adversary by weight of numbers ironically worked against them: every Spanish thrust went home. On the edges of the fray, Spanish lancers and swordsmen on horse were a nightmare with their swift slashing movements. The Aztec thought them at first a single, two-headed animal.* All of this testifies to the fundamental advantage of ferrous metallurgy. Weapons were only part of the story. The Spanish depended completely on such iron objects as shovels, picks, axes, hammers, anvils, tools. They needed to make horseshoes and affix them, to repair weapons, to replace things broken. Every nail, every piece of iron was precious, because it had to come from Spain. A horseshoe cost 30 pesos; nails, 80 pesos the hundred. Many a horseman found it cheaper to have his animal shod with gold.7 The Aztec response to these tactics was drastically weakened by uncertain, wavering leadership.

Cortés had burned his vessels, which told his men that they could not run. They had to fight or die. Or worse than die: the Aztecs made sure the Spanish knew the fate of Mexican prisoners, displaying bloody, flayed bodies on their walls. Another mistake in tactics.

Its limits, as for the Aztecs in Mexico, were set pardy by nature—the Incas were never comfortable in heavy forest—and pardy by the opposition of such recalcitrant tribes as the Araucanians.

Inca society was something like an anthill: everyone worked, even the litde children, from the age of five on. The women spun thread while walking, and the story has it that the roads were built smooth to keep them from tripping; they were too busy to watch their feet. Except for local barter, trade was reserved to the authorities. Some scholars have called the system socialist, in that so much of the social product was delivered to the center for ultimate redistribution, and that may be a reasonable appellation; but the system was in form and effect not different from those prevailing in other aristocratic despotisms, with their "prime divider" separating a small elite from the large, relatively undifferentiated mass. Like these, Inca society had its leveling, homogenizing aspects: rough and humble in subsistence and appearance, just about everyone learned to eat and wait by squatting on haunches. The rulers were set apart by dress and furniture and diet—among other things, the right to "turn on" by chewing coca. Common

The trouble began around Cape Bojador (27° N . ) , symbolic boundary between creation and chaos, where struggling waters made the sea seem to boil. A decade of probes (1424-34) turned back at this invisible barrier. 1 But still the Portuguese pressed on, voyage after voyage, league after league. At first they thought that no one lived along that arid coast; but then they encountered a few natives, took some prisoners, learned of slavery, saw new opportunities for profit. For profit was the heart of the matter: as Prince Henry's biographer-hagiographer Zurara put it, " ... it is evident that [no sailor or merchant] would want to go to a place where he did not stand to make money."2 The South Adantic is like no other ocean.

After decades of beating and tacking their way south, they filled their sails and took the audacious step of swinging well out to the west, clear across the ocean to Brazil, before turning back to the southeast. This added hundreds of leagues to the route and meant weeks, even months out of sight of land; but the effect was to shorten the voyage and give them clear sailing around the point of Africa into friendlier seas. One must not think of this as luck. The Portuguese could do this because they had learned to find the latitude. In the North Atlantic, sailors had always read their location north-south by the height of the Pole star. As they approached the equator, however, the Pole star stood too low in the sky, and they had to rely on the sun for guidance. Here the problem was complicated by the changing position of the sun in the sky: in European summer, it stood farther north, hence higher; in winter, farther south. This variance in position, known as declination, had to be taken into account in reading the sun's altitude as the measure of latitude. Here Iberia's position as frontier and bridge between civilizations paid off. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Arab and Jewish astronomers there (the key figure was Abraham Zacut) prepared convenient tables of solar declination for the use of navigators.4 Once one could find the latitude, both at sea and on land, one had the key to the oceans; for now one could know position north-south; and if one also knew the latitude of the destination, one could get there by sailing to and then following the parallel. (Occasional problem: should one turn east or west?) The most important information that Bartolomeu Dias brought back from his voyage (1488) was the coordinate of the southern tip of Africa. Knowing that, the Portuguese could find their way there from any part of the South Atiantic. These explorations had taken the Portuguese the better part of a century. Some of this was the work of the Portuguese crown and its devout, single-minded prince (we are told that he died a virgin) come down to us as Henry the Navigator, who built a marine research station at Sagres on a promontory overlooking the ocean and directed decades of inquiry into the science and technique of steering and sailing

Every trip was an experience, an incentive to emendation. Ocean sailing further depended on instrumentation: the compass for direction; the astrolabe and cross-staff for measuring altitudes of celestial bodies; devices for sighting with back turned to the sun; sandglasses for timing and estimating speed. And, lest we forget, all sailing depended on the tenacity of hard-bitten sailors

The Portuguese strategy, doing by knowing, made good sense. Each trip built on the ones before; each time, they went a little farther; each time they noted their latitude, changed their maps, and left a marker of presence. Psychological barriers made some steps more difficult: thus Cape Bojador; also the Cape of Storms, later renamed of Good Hope (symbolism was important). Gradually, fear yielded to reason and method. The decision to sail west, almost to the coast of South America, before going east was the most inventive and audacious of all, showing tremendous confidence in their ability to find their way. (By comparison, Columbus had a cakewalk.) Better to keep moving than to tack and stand. N o wind like a following wind; no sail like a full sail

Columbus's discovery of a new world shocked the Portuguese. Like Sputnik to the Americans. After all, they could have had him and had turned him down. Decades of painful, costly exploration reaching around Africa, and here the Spanish found a new world (or maybe Asia) on the first try. N o justice. Time to get going: in July of 1497 a small flotilla of four ships under the command of Vasco da Gama set forth from Lisbon to follow on the aborted initiative of Bartolomeu Dias and, rounding Africa, to find India. The voyage would take them over 27,000 miles and over two years; and only fifty-four of the original crew of one hundred seventy returned alive. This costly probe did not prove a commercial success. To da Gama's astonishment, the merchants he encountered in India were Muslims and had no intention of trading with Christian infidels; what's more, the glass beads, trinkets, and shirts he had brought with him for barter or sale, though eminentiy attractive to natives of the Caribbean, were near to worthless in India, which knew the difference between trash and precious things and made far better fabrics than Europe. So da Gama returned more or less empty-handed. The little he did bring back was a prize of war; in his eagerness and desperation, he attacked and captured a small Muslim vessel with a cargo of spices. Not a good precedent: from that point on, the Portuguese would rely on force to establish themselves in the Indian Ocean rather than on market competition. Much more important, da Gama brought back news—two kinds of news. The first: that Europeans were stronger than the natives; they had better ships and better guns. The second: that although he had not been able to trade, spices aplenty were to be had for prices

A hundredweight of pepper could be had in Calicut for three ducats. After passing through the hands of a halfdozen intermediaries and paying substantial fees and bribes to kings, sheikhs, and officials along the way, it sold in Venice for 80. Against that kind of gain, what was the cost of outfitting a fleet? And what the value of seamen's lives? This was Portugal's revenge. King

In early 1500, less than six months after da Gama's triumphal return, the Portuguese sent out a second fleet to the Indies—thirteen ships this time and one thousand two hundred men, including soldiers—under the command of Pedro Alvares Cabrai. They sent him to make money and told him not to look for trouble; but if a hostile vessel should try to do him harm, he was not to let it come near, but rather to stand off and blow it out of the water. Nothing better illustrates awareness of superiority. For it is well known that those who possess stronger arms can kill from a distance at no risk to themselves; whereas those in a position of weakness must close and rely on personal valor and strength to gain a victory

the instructions (Regimento) to Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1508 for the exploration of Madagascar: 1. The fleet was to follow the circumference of the island, with special attention to the west coast (the side facing Africa); enter and study every port, reconnoiter means of entry and exit, explore the possibilities of anchorage with reference to winds, currents, and nature of bottom; and write all of this down [my italics]. 2. First contact with the natives: show them a range of articles and metals (spices, wax, copper) to see if these things are known on the island; and if there, ask how to get to them and trade for them. Find out what they would want in exchange. 3. Find out what if any other ships come in to these ports. Where do they come from? What do they carry? Do they trade these in other islands or carry different things to different places? Where do the merchants and crews of these ships come from? Are they Muslim or pagan ("gentiles") ? White or black? How are they dressed? D o they come armed? 4. Are these other ships big or small? What kind? What are the seasons of their coming and going? The rhythm (annual, more often)? Their way of navigating? 5. Does the island have its own vessels, and if so, where do they go, what do they carry, what do they seek? 6. What does the island produce, what will the natives take for it? Are these things dear or cheap? 7. Political structure: what kinds of kings or lords, whether Muslim or pagan? How do they live? How do they administer justice? What do they possess? Do they hold treasure? What kind of state and dignity, and how do they maintain it? What military force and arms: elephants or horses, weapons, firearms, artillery of any kind? Are the soldiers timid or warlike? 8. Are there Muslim rulers apart, independent; and do they recognize the pagan rulers? 9. Is the population Muslim or pagan? If the latter, how do the Muslims live with them? Are there Christians as in India?* D o they know St. Thomas? 10. What are the customs? Are they, in part at least, like those of the Malabars? * T h e first P o r t u g u e s e t o arrive in I n d i a w e r e m i s l e d by native idolatry into thinking that H i n d u i s m w a s an exotic f o r m o f Christianity

. Are there cities, towns, or villages of special importance? Are they fortified? How is the land inhabited? 12. Money? Is there some standard tender, or are there simply "moneys," like those of Manicongo [Africa?]? In this regard do they trade copper as a commodity, and in that case, what things are made of it? In particular, is it used for casting guns and if so, what kind? Also in that case, how do they make gunpowder? A similar questionnaire for Malacca (Malay peninsula) adds a detailed question about the Chinese who traded in those parts: vessels and techniques of navigation? arms and style of war? trade, merchants, trading posts, merchandise, prices? political power? clothing and manners? size and shape of China?6 These systematic inquiries went back in Portugal at least to 1425, beginning with the exploration of the Canaries

The contrast with Spain is marked. The Spanish did not adopt this methodical approach until the last quarter of the sixteenth century. Either they did not need it (no competition; simpler navigation), or it did not accord with their tradition and style. Whereas the Portuguese sealed claims of possession by asserting discovery, that is, by entering latitudes on maps, the Spanish asserted material facts. They planted crosses, "converted" natives, built Christian edifices, installed tribunals and jails. As for objectives, the Spanish aimed at treasure; the Portuguese, at profits from trade. Two views of empire.

The history of European commercial and political expansion into the Indian Ocean and East Asia is dominated by the question of a mighthave-been. What if the sixteenth century were not a period of Asian political disarray, of war in India between native states and Turcoman invaders, of Chinese isolationism, a low as it were, exposing Asia to the ruthless thrusts of these invaders? The Chinese "absence" hurt especially. From 1405 to 1431, the Chinese undertook at least seven major naval expeditions to explore the waters of Indonesia and the Indian Ocean. These voyages aimed to show the Chinese flag, bestow awareness and knowledge of the Celestial Kingdom on the barbarians, receive homage and tribute, and collect for the emperor those few rarities

The relationship of these voyages to trade is not entirely clear. The ships carried valuable commodities (silks, porcelain) that were intended for exchange, but apparentiy not in the open market; rather, in the context of gift giving: tribute from the barbarians, benevolence from the Chinese. On the other hand, the sorties were apparentiy intended to open the way to normal trade, and merchants did come along to make their own deals. Independent trading voyages followed, presumably profiting from enhanced Chinese prestige. But if trade was one of the objectives, this was a very costiy way to go about it. In effect the Chinese people were paying for the profits of the officials who organized the treasure fleets and promoted private trade, so much indeed that the burden of these voyages came to exceed the empire's means

The first of these fleets, that of the eunuch admiral Zheng He (Cheng-ho) in 1405, consisted of 317 vessels and carried 28,000 men.1 0 From 1404 to 1407, China undertook an orgy of shipbuilding and refitting. Whole seaboard provinces were drawn into the effort, while inland forests were stripped for timber. Hundreds of households of carpenters, smiths, sailmakers, ropemakers, caulkers, carters and haulers, even timekeepers, were moved by fiat, grouped into teams

In this way, over a period of three years, the Chinese built or refitted some 1,681 ships. Medieval Europe could not have conceived of such an armada.1 1 Yet this Chinese opening to the sea and the larger world came to naught, indeed was deliberately reduced to naught.* In the 1430s a new emperor reigned in Peking, one who "knew not Joseph." A new, Confucian crowd competed for influence, mandarins who scorned and distrusted commerce (for them, the only true source of wealth was agriculture) and detested the eunuchs who had planned and carried out the great voyages. For some decades, the two groups vied for influence, the balance shifting now one way, now the other. But fiscality and the higher Chinese morality were on the Confucian side. The maritime campaign had strained the empire's finances and weakened its authority over a population bled white by taxes and corvée levies. The decision (early fifteenth century) to move the capital to Peking made things worse: new city walls, a palace compound of over nine thousand rooms, peasants liable in principle for thirty days service but kept at work for years running. The transportation bill alone—moving the court from Nanking, some eight hundred miles—drove tax surcharges upward.1 2 A few conscientious officials spoke up, but the imperial courtiers stifled them by severe and humiliating penalties. A prefect who protested the extra requisitions was put in a cage and wheeled in disgrace to the capital to be interrogated by the emperor. So much for duty. Meanwhile, on the northwest frontier, a changing but unchanging cast of nomadic raiders gave the empire no peace, draining resources and demanding undivided attention

From 1436, requests for the assignment of new craftsmen to the shipyards were refused, while conversely, foreigners asking for the renewal of customary gifts were turned down, presumably for reasons of economy. For want of construction and repair, public and private fleets shrank. Pirates flourished in unguarded waters (the Japanese were particularly active), and China placed ever more reliance on inland canal transport. By 1500, anyone who built a ship of more than two masts was liable to the death penalty, and in 1525 coastal authorities were enjoined to destroy all oceangoing ships and to arrest their owners. Finally in 1551, it became a crime to go to sea on a multimasted ship, even for trade.1 3 The abandonment of the program of great voyages was part of a larger policy of closure, of retreat from the hazards and temptations of the sea. This deliberate introversion, a major turning point in Chinese history, could not have come at a worse time, for it not only disarmed them in the face of rising European power but set them, complacent and stubborn, against the lessons and novelties that European travelers would soon be bringing. Why? Why did China not make

Why, decades and even centuries after the arrival of European visitors in Chinese waters, were there no Chinese vessels in the harbors of Europe? (The first such vessel, a vehicle for diplomacy, visited London for the Great Exhibition of 1851.) As always, there are several reasons. The result, in sociological jargon, is overdetermined. To begin with, the Chinese lacked range, focus, and above all, curiosity. They went to show themselves, not to see and learn; to bestow their presence, not to stay; to receive obeisance and tribute, not to buy. They were what they were and did not have to change. They had what they had and did not have to take or make. Unlike the Europeans, they were not motivated by greed and passion. The Europeans had a specific target: the wealth of the Indies. They had to get around Africa; that was the point of the exercise. The Chinese did not have to. They could find what they wanted in the Indian Ocean, and what they wanted was so trivial that it was not an appetizer but a dessert

On the surface, the Chinese were immeasurably stronger and richer. Who could stand up to them? Yet reality ran the other way. The Chinese had learned the secret of gunpowder before the Europeans, but the Europeans had better guns and greater firepower, especially at a distance. The Chinese had bigger ships, but the Europeans were better navigators. If we compare the two sides around 1400, the Chinese might have come out on top, at least in the Indian Ocean or South China Sea. (Even a strong animal has trouble defeating his weaker prey close to home.) But fifty years later, even in Asian waters, the Europeans would have run circles around the Chinese vessels. Of course, the Chinese might have learned by experience and eventually met the Europeans with comparable weapons and ships. That is one of the problems with hypotheticals: they are open-ended, and confidence levels diminish with speculation. Isolationism became China. Round, complete, apparentiy serene, ineffably harmonious, the Celestial Empire purred along for hundreds of years more, impervious and imperturbable. But the world was passing it by

Not long ago the world was getting ready to celebrate the five hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. One group after another competed to honor the man and the achievement. In the United States, which some would have named Columbia, where some seventy cities and towns and a large number of fair and fraternal institutions bear the discoverer's name, where people of Italian descent have vied with Hispanics to draw merit and honor from their countryman (whether by descent or adoption), one could reasonably expect a repetition engrand of the quadricentennial of 1892: a world's fair (the Columbian Exposition); mementos galore; and the following year, richly colored issues of commemorative stamps. People felt good about Columbus in those days,

the expectation was that 1992 would be bigger and better (500 beats 400) ; but then something, everything, went wrong. Columbus, symbol of historical achievement, midwife of a new world, turned out to be a political embarrassment. It emerged—but there had been rumblings of dissent for years—that many people did not see the Admiral of the Ocean Sea as a hero, the European arrival in the New World as a discovery, the anniversary of this event as occasion for celebration

As in most iconoclastic subversions of tradition, the attack on Columbus—or more accurately, on what followed his arrival—contains much truth, much nonsense, and some irrelevancy. The truth lies in the unhappy fate of the indigenous peoples the Europeans found in the New World. With rare, trivial, and ineffectual exceptions, they were treated with contempt, violence, and sadistic brutality. They were almost wiped out by the microbes and viruses the Europeans unknowingly brought with them. Their land and culture and dignity were taken from them. They have nothing to celebrate. The nonsense lies in quibbles about discovery: How could Columbus have discovered the New World? It was always there. The natives knew their land. It was they who had discovered it long before

with Columbus's discovery: once the news got back, thinking about the world and its peoples—the human imagination—was changed forever. The irrelevancy lies in the argument that emphasis on the Columbian discovery Europeanizes a world process of encounter and exchange; that this Eurocentrism induces an easy triumphalism, leading historians to accentuate the false positive (the great age of exploration) and ignore the true negative (the catastrophic consequences of invasion). Some of this complaint is true, but a good historian tries to keep his balance. The opening of the New World (for Europe it was new) was an exchange, but asymmetric. The European epiphany was the one that mattered. Europe it was that initiated the process, responded to the discovery, and set the agenda for further developments. On the operative level—who did to whom—this was a one-way business. As for the self-congratulatory grandeur of these events, people, big and small, snatch at prestige where they may; and once invented, myths die hard. Yet the heroic discovery myths have not commanded the assent of scholars for many years—certainly not in the professional literature

The discovery of the New World by Europeans was not an accident. Europe now held a decisive advantage in the power to kill. It could deliver its weapons wherever ships could take them; and thanks to new navigational techniques, European ships could now go anywhere. Here let us pause a moment to consider the larger implications of this inequality. I would put forward a law of social and political relationships, namely, that three factors cannot coexist: ( 1 ) a marked disparity of power; (2) private access to the instruments of power; and (3) equality of groups or nations. Where one group is strong enough to push another around and stands to gain by it, it will do so. Even if the state would abstain from aggression, companies and individuals will not wait for permission. Rather, they will act in their own interest, dragging others along, including the state. That is why imperialism (the domination by one group of another) has always been with us.* It is the expression of a deep human drive

the war against the Muslim was going on in other places too, most notably in Spain, where over the course of the following centuries (final victory, Granada 1492) Christian kingdoms had increasing success against a multitude of jealous successor sheikhdoms. These were the debris of el-Andalus: "every qa'id and man of influence who could command a score of followers or possessed a castle to retire to in case of need, styled himself sultan and assumed the insignia of royalty."8 In this intermittent combat, the Muslims were handicapped by their dependence on Berber soldiers brought over from North Africa

logistics and demography favored the Christians. "Christendom was spreading slowly south, as if by a process of titration rather than flood."9 In the end, civilization succumbed and ferocity triumphed. Cordoba, once the greatest center of learning in Europe, fell in 1236; Seville, the great economic metropolis of el-Andalus, in 1248. Both were taken almost in a fit of absent-mindedness: Ferdinand III of Castile did not really think he was ready to roll up the Moors in the valley of the Guadalquivir. The emir made a deal to withdraw as Ferdinand's vassal to the tiny mountain stronghold of Granada, which hung on by pursuing a strategy of timorous collaboration and systematic indifference to the fate of fellow Muslims in other parts. As ye sow . . . when it was Granada's turn to go ( 1 4 9 0 - 9 2 ), its appeals for help went unanswered. So the last Moorish ruler of Granada negotiated a wellpaid exit and left Spain scorned by his own mother: she knew a coward when she saw one. The victors in this reconquista were Portugal, which liberated its territory from the Muslims by the mid-fourteenth century, and Castile, an expansionist frontier state of caballero pastoralists (what we would call cowboys) and roughnecks and soldiers of fortune for whom the great Moorish cities of the south, with their marble palaces and cool fountains, green gardens and centers of learning, were an irresistible target.1 0 And after reconquista, then what? Well, the land had to be grabbed up and resetded, estates bounded and exploited, peasants (especially Muslim cultivators) set to work for their new lords. And the kingdom had to be Christianized, for Queen Isabella was a passionate believer. Whatever concessions to Islam had been made by way of negotiating the surrender of Grenada, no such commitment could long hold against the claims of true faith. The Church, through the Holy Office of the Inquisition, to say nothing of lay spies and snitches, kept very busy. Converts from Judaism, most of them involuntary, hence untrustworthy, had to be kept under close surveillance; the same for exMuslims.

Even before the final expulsion of the Moor from the Iberian peninsula, Portugal and Spain were moving on to probe and attack beyond the water. The first targets were islands in the Mediterranean and the shores of North Africa. King Jaime I of Aragon took the Balearics in 1229-35 and boasted of it later as "the best thing man has done in the last hundred years." The Portuguese in turn took Ceuta in 1415; Casablanca in 1463; Tangiers in 1471. War has a way of legitimating its cause and celebrating its conquests. So with these new crusaders: poets sang their praises and they sublimated their violence in chivalric codes and posturing. Maritime expeditions took on special virtue and merit

It takes money to fight. The pattern of these "noble" quests was that of the traditional, feudal "business" enterprise. Some baron—what one historian calls an "aristocratic hooligan"—set off at the head of a war band with the ruler's blessing and sometimes his money, often in ships furnished by merchants near and far, to grab what he could grab. What he could take and hold was his, subject to distribution of spoil and rewards to his men, dividends to his backers, and a commitment of support and loyalty to his overlord. The choice of targets was not random. These brigands began with the closest places, the most accessible. An economist would say: low cost of entry. These targets, moreover, were held by infidels, and this alone sanctified the venture

Beyond these nearby victims lay an alluring array of distant temptations: gold that came by camel from no one knew where across the African desert; spices imported from the Indian Ocean through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, then overland to ports in the Levant, passing through numerous hands along the way and rising in price with every transaction; fabulous silks come by caravan all the way from China.

Rumor and legend told of greater wonders, the stuff of dreams: on the other side of Africa, the kingdom of Prester John, a Christian enclave in the world of Islam; somewhere nearby, the lost paradise of Eden; farther east, the land of Xanadu; and going west, well, that was the unknown. Most people understood the world was round and that one could in theory go east by sailing west. But the Atlantic was a terrifying ocean for those used to the waters of the inland sea. Even the seaboard populations saw only the awful emptiness. Names like Land's End and Finisterre were more than mere statements of topographical fact. Where there is ignorance, fantasy reigns. The west was the place of the Blessed Isles, of the mysterious Atlantis now sunk beneath the waves—of magical realms guarded by monsters and whirlpools and sea spouts—all the hazards that realism and imagination could put together. It took tremendous courage to venture into the ocean sea, well beyond any of the landmarks that dotted the portolan maps and gave reassurance from point to coastal point. The Viking voyages, west and north and west again, testify to their seamanship and courage; also to an intimate knowledge of the water (its color, moods, and depths, even its bottom) and the fauna (the fish and birds) that enabled them to know the presence of land long before they saw it and thus to islandhop around the top of the Atlantic. The Genoese and other Italians came later, learning first to round Iberia and sail to England. By the fourteenth century, in the company of Portuguese and Basques, they found the near Atlantic isles: the Azores, Madeiras,1 2 Canaries—all but the last, which lie close to the African mainland, uninhabited.* (The Cape Verde Islands, which lie south of Bojador at north latitude 15°, were not found by Europeans until the mid-fifteenth century

These tiny islands do not seem much today. They have been reduced to outposts, visited only by tourists or by residents returning from studies or jobs on the mainland. In the decades following their discovery, however, they represented a major addition to European space. Note that the Canaries were known to the ancient Romans, who learned of them from the king of Mauretania. They did not add to Roman space. It takes a mix of knowledge, means, and need to turn discovery into opportunity.

the southern islands (Madeiras and Canaries) proved superbly suited to the cultivation of sugar cane, destined to become Europe's greatest money crop. Europeans first encountered this plant in the Middle East, where the Arabs had brought it from India and thence into the Mediterranean, to Cyprus, Crete, and the Maghreb. Returning crusaders in turn introduced it into Europe—into Greece, Sicily, the Portuguese Algarve. Sugar is powerfully addictive, naturally pleasing to the palate (not a learned taste) and comforting to the human psyche. It cost a great deal at first and was limited to pharmaceutical uses; one bought it at the apothecary's, and most Europeans got their sweetness from fruit and honey. But this was not the first time that a medicinal substance came to appeal to the healthy as well as the sick. Thanks to spreading cultivation, price fell to the point where sugar could be found at the grocer's. Now it began to be used as a condiment with all manner of fare; as the German saying had it, there's no food can be spoiled by sugar. (Germans still cook that way.) It also proved useful as a preservative or flavor camouflage in a world of easy spoilage. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, sugar was a luxury: mistresses locked the loaves up to keep them from the servants; but it was becoming a necessity, spreading from the top of the social hierarchy on down

As successful as the Mediterranean centers of cultivation were, they could not compare with the Atiantic islands, for reasons both climatic and social. Sugar cane grows best in tropical or subtropical climes. It needs a lot of regular water, and it likes steady heat—both found in these near-equatorial lands set down in the path of rain-heavy trade winds. It also takes a lot of hard gang labor, the sort of thing shunned by free men, so that cultivators preferred slaves where available. This is what the crusaders found when they captured such Mediterranean islands as Cyprus: the Arab sugar industry ran on slave labor, most of it brought in from East Africa

Slavery had long since given way to serfdom, in part because Christians were not supposed to be held as slaves (among other things because chattel status was incompatible with the sacrament of marriage), in part because the supply of pagan or infidel slaves was small and unreliable—also self-liquidating by conversion. Blacks, to be sure, might be seen as an exception. One might question whether they had a soul, whether they could become Christian. We know the Portuguese had no qualms importing black slaves for domestic service or for labor in the cane fields of the coastal plain; some 10 percent of the population of Lisbon in the mid-sixteenth century was apparently black.1 3 Yet many (how many?) of these were eventually manumitted, and they merged into the population at large. The institution of black slavery, in spite of occasional "blackamoor" servants come down to us in oil paintings of elegant interiors, never took hold in Europe. If Europeans were going to use black slaves for field work, they wanted it done far away. The Atlantic islands were far away. Here was a tabula rasa, a laboratory for new social arrangements. One can follow the progression. The Azores and Madeiras were initially peopled by European settlers or by unfree persons who had no choice in the matter—convicts, prostitutes, victims and orphans of religious persecution.* The Cape Verde Islands, on the other hand, off the coast of Gambia, were ideally placed to tap the slave trade that flourished a short reach away, and were soon shipping blacks to Lisbon and to some of the other islands. When African slavers found that the white man, come for gold and pepper, was also interested in this human commodity, they were ready. In the quarter century before Columbus, the Cape Verde Islands and to a lesser extent the Madeiras became a testing ground for slave sugar plantations, to be followed by Sao Tome in the sixteenth century. Those planters tough enough to drill and squeeze labor while standing up to hardship and climate made fortunes;

These plantations then served as models for later, even more profitable developments in the New World. The Atlantic islands enormously extended Europe's reach. In a few bold leaps, seamen found sailing platforms hundreds of miles westward and southward, launching pads into the unknown, harbors home. Here were oases in the ocean desert: they eased the pain and made the impossible possible. Was it luck or forethought that led Columbus to the farthest Canary isle, right in the path of the great easterlies, before setting out? Whatever; he found himself on the boulevard of the equatorial trades, and those warm, steady winds drove him across the Atlantic in a month. Crazy. But in 1492 the Spanish thought they could do anything. Columbus was a maverick. He wanted to go to Asia by going west, which held no interest for Portugal. But the plan made sense to Spain, which had agreed to divide the world with Portugal and had conceded the eastern (African) route to its rival—another testimony to the hubris of these kingdoms. For Spain, it was westward ho! or nothing. Columbus happened to underestimate his task: he thought the world much smaller than it was. But that was not a bad way to begin; the ocean was in fact narrower than he thought.

What Columbus did not find was great treasure of gold or silk or spices or any of the other valuables associated with the Orient. Gold above all he wanted, not so much for himself (he wanted rank and fame more) as for his monarchs, for he understood that nothing was so likely to keep the crown interested and supportive. The scarcity of gold was a disappointment, but he made the best of things and assured that these islands could be an abundant source of slaves; that they were moreover eminentiy suitable for sugar cultivation, which he knew from the Canaries and Madeiras. They would also support livestock; and so it went

The gold that found its way from somewhere in Africa to the Mediterranean coast held European merchants in thrall. They went to places like Tunis to trade silver and arms, textiles and leather, rice and figs, nuts and wine (presumably for re-export) for grain and fodder, oils, fats, semolina, and honey; and then—to balance payments—for gold. Gold dust, gold ingots, gold coins (Moorish ducats). Not only did the yellow metal cast an almost hypnotic lure, the rate of exchange made these transactions extremely lucrative

Silver traded for gold at 10 to 1 in Tunis in the first half of the fourteenth century, but that same gold would buy 13 units of silver in the markets of Valencia. Such a disparity could not last; active trade makes a working market, and a market makes for homogeneous prices. By the middle of the fourteenth century, the ratio was 10.5:1 in Naples, 11:1 in Florence. The influx from Africa was such that much of the western Mediterranean went over to a gold standard, as reflected in new coinages: the piermle dyoro in Sicily, the reial d'oro in Majorca, the alfonsino in Sardinia (1339), the gold florin in Aragon (1346). Literary and cartographic sources dating back to the midthirteenth century attest to the Latin fascination with this gold and its unknown mother lode. The suppliers, however, took pains to keep the source secret—no doubt wisely, for they correctly surmised that the Christian infidels would kill and die for gold. We know now that the gold came from deep in the interior of West Africa, somewhere along the upper reaches of the Niger and near the headwaters of the Gambia and Senegal rivers. The story has it that the blacks who mined the gold exchanged it by "dumb" barter: the buyers left trade goods at an appointed place and then withdrew, and the miners then took the goods and left what they felt was an appropriate amount of gold in payment. The mystery, needless to say, was an invitation to fantasy. Some said the gold grew there like carrots; others affirmed that it was brought up from under the ground by diligent and serviable ants; others that it was mined by naked men who lived in holes. In any event, the precious metal had to pass from its source through the legendary African kingdom of Mali, which controlled access to Timbuktu and the cross-Sahara camel routes and was the farthest "upstream" source known to the Mediterranean merchants. There the bullion traders paid a heavy tribute to the local middlemen and the ruler, known as the Mansa; as the story has it, Mali took the nuggets and left the dust to the traders. (A mill to grind and flake the nuggets might have proved handy.) From time to time, the Mansa and his agents tried to increase revenue by forcing the diggers to produce more. Such efforts foundered on the passive resistance of the miners, who just stopped delivering

months in Egypt, and the visit was remembered for centuries thereafter. He gave 50,000 dinars to the Sultan, who was not above taking so princely a gift, and thousands of ingots to the shrines he visited and the officials who entertained and ministered to him. By the end of his stay, we are told, the value of gold in Egypt had fallen by 10 to 25 percent. Though the Mansa had come with a fortune in expense money— eighty to one hundred camels bearing 300 pounds of gold each (equals from 110 to 135 million of our dollars!)—he was penniless by the end of his pilgrimage and had to borrow for his return. His creditors were well reimbursed for their confidence, at 700 dinars for every 300 he had borrowed

"The Admiral said he could not believe that a man could have ever beheld people so good of heart, so generous and timid, because they all gave away everything they had to us Christians and ran to give us whatever they had as soon as they saw us." And: "In exchange for anything you give them, no matter how trifling, they immediately give you all their possessions." And: "They do not covet other people's property. . . . Whatever you ask for that belongs to them, they never refuse. On the contrary, they ask you to help yourself, and show so much love that you give them your heart." And: "They are very gende and know nothing of evil. They know nothing of killing one another."1 9 But such an idyllic image could not long survive the test of experience. In particular, one thing these generous people were not ready to give away, and that was their women. And that was the one thing that, after months at sea, these horny Spaniards wanted above all, more even than gold. Also, the same innocents who were ready to give freely of their possessions assumed the Spanish would do the same. So they took, which the Spanish defined as theft. The very Columbus who had waxed rhapsodic on arrival soon repented himself of his credulity and offered some practical advice to his men: "During your voyage to Cibao, if an Indian steals anything at all, you must punish him by cutting off his nose and his hands, because these are the parts of the body that they cannot hide

Tzvetan Todorov would add the factor of distance: the Spanish were operating far from home and exercising their power and wrath on strangers, on an Other defined as subhuman and hence outside or beneath the rules that governed comportment even against an enemy. In such circumstances, anything goes; nothing is forbidden. So they competed in imagining and doing evil, which thus fairly exploded in collective frenzies. Todorov adds: "The 'barbarity' of the Spanish has nothing atavistic or animal about it; it is perfectly human and announces the arrival of modern times.

1. The water wheel. It had been known to the Romans, who began to do interesting things with it during the last century of the empire, when the conquests were over and the supply of slaves had shrunk almost to nothing. By then it was too late; order and trade were breaking down. The device may well have survived on Church estates, where it freed clerics for prayer. In any event, it was revived in the tenth and eleventh centuries, multiplying easily in a region of wide rainfall and ubiquitous watercourses. In England, that peripheral, backward island, the Domesday census of 1086 showed some 5,600 of these mills; the Continent had many more

Millwrights increased pressure and efficiency by building dams and ponds and by lining the wheels up to utilize the diminishing energy for a variety of tasks, beginning with those that needed the most power, and descending. At the same time, the invention or improvement of accessory devices—cranks, toothed gears—made it possible to use the power at a distance, change its direction, convert it from rotary to reciprocating motion, and apply it to an increasing variety of tasks: hence not only grinding grain, but fulling (pounding) cloth, thereby transforming the woolen manufacture; hammering metal; rolling and drawing sheet metal and wire; mashing hops for beer; pulping rags for paper. "Paper, which was manufactured by hand and foot for a thousand years or so following its invention by the Chinese and adoption by the Arabs, was manufactured mechanically as soon as it reached medieval Europe in the thirteenth century. . . .

the invention of spectacles more than doubled the working life of skilled craftsmen, especially those who did fine jobs: scribes (crucial before the invention of printing) and readers, instrument and toolmakers, close weavers, metalworkers. The problem is biological: because the crystalline lens of the human eye hardens around the age of forty, it produces a condition similar to farsightedness (actually presbyopia). The eye can no longer focus on close objects. But around the age of forty, a medieval craftsman could reasonably expect to live and work another twenty years, the best years of his working life . . . if he could see well enough. Eyeglasses solved the problem. We think we know where and when the first spectacles appeared. Crude magnifying glasses and crystals (lapides ad legendum) had been found earlier and used for reading.3 The trick was to improve them so as to reduce distortion and connect a pair into a wearable device, thus leaving the hands free. This apparently first happened in Pisa toward the end of the thirteenth century.

medieval optical technology, however primitive, was saved by the nature of the difficulty: the lenses to correct presbyopia do not have to be extremely accurate. Their function is primarily to magnify, and although some magnify more than others, just about any and all will help the user. This is why people will occasionally borrow glasses in a restaurant to read the menu, and why fiveand-dime stores can put out boxes of such spectacles for sale. The buyer simply tries a few and picks the most suitable. Myopes (shortsighted people) cannot do that

Eyeglasses made it possible to do fine work and use fine instruments. But also the converse: eyeglasses encouraged the invention of fine instruments, indeed pushed Europe in a direction found nowhere else. The Muslims knew the astrolabe, but that was it. The Europeans went on to invent gauges, micrometers, fine wheel cutters—a battery of tools linked to precision measurement and control. They thereby laid the basis for articulated machines with fitted parts. Close work: when other civilizations did it, they did it by long habituation. The skill was in the hand, not the eye-and-tool. They achieved remarkable results, but no piece was like any other; whereas Europe was already moving toward replication—batch and then mass production. This knowledge of lenses, moreover, was a school for further optical advances, and not only in Italy. Both telescope and microscope were invented in the Low Countries around 1600 and spread quickly from there

Before the invention of this machine, people told time by sun (shadow sticks or dials) and water clocks. Sun clocks worked of course only on clear days; water clocks misbehaved when the temperature fell toward freezing, to say nothing of long-run drift as a result of sedimentation and clogging. Both of these devices served reasonably well in sunny climes; but north of the Alps one can go weeks without seeing the sun, while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night. Medieval Europe gave new importance to reliable time. The Church first, with its seven daily prayer offices, one of which, matins, was in spite of its name a nocturnal rite and required an alarm arrangement to wake clerics before dawn.

and then of course the length of these hours varied with the seasons. But the mechanical clock kept equal hours, and this implied a new time reckoning. The Church resisted, not coming over to the new hours for about a century. From the start, however, the towns and cities took equal hours as their standard, and the public clocks installed in the towers and belfries of town halls and market squares became the very symbol of a new, secular municipal authority. Every town wanted one; conquerors seized them as specially precious spoils of war; tourists came to see and hear these machines the way they made pilgrimages to sacred relics. New times, new customs. The clock was the greatest achievement of medieval mechanical ingenuity

This was the first example of a digital as opposed to an analog device: it counted a regular, repeating sequence of discrete actions (the swings of an oscillating controller) rather than tracked continuous, regular motion such as the moving shadow of a sundial or the flow of water. Today we know that such a repeating frequency can be more regular than any continuous phenomenon, and just about all high-precision devices are now based on the digital principle. But no one could have known that in the thirteenth century, which thought that because time was continuous, it ought to be tracked and measured by some other continuity. The mechanical clock had to meet the unsparing standards of earth and sun; no blinking or hiding its failures. The result was relentless pressure to improve technique and design. At every stage, clockmakers led the way to accuracy and precision: masters of miniaturization, detectors and correctors of error, searchers for new and better. They remain the pioneers of mechanical engineering—examples and teachers to other branches. Finally, the clock brought order and control, both collective and personal. Its public display and private possession laid the basis for temporal autonomy: people could now coordinate comings and goings without dictation from above. (Contrast the military, where only officers need know the time.) The clock provided the punctuation marks for group activity, while enabling individuals to order their own work (and that of others) so as to enhance productivity. Indeed, the very notion of productivity is a by-product of the clock

work is never the same. One moves from the task-oriented time consciousness of the peasant (one job after another, as time and light permit) and the time-filling busyness of the domestic servant (always something to do) to an effort to maximize product per unit of time (time is money). The invention of the mechanical clock anticipates in its effects the economic analysis of Adam Smith: increase in the wealth of nations derives directly from improvement of the productive powers of labor.

The Chinese treated time and knowledge of time as a confidential aspect of sovereignty, not to be shared with the people. This monopoly touched both daily and year-round time. In the cities, drums and other noisemakers signaled the hours (equal to two of our hours), and everywhere the imperial calendar defined the seasons and their activities. Nor was this calendar a uniform, objectively determinable datum. Each emperor in turn had his own calendar, placed his own seal on the passage of time. Private calendrical calculation would have been pointless. These interval hour signals in large cities were no substitute for continuing knowledge and awareness. In particular, the noises were not numerical signifiers. The hours had names rather than numbers, and that in itself testifies to the absence of a temporal calculus. Without a basis in popular consumption, without a clock trade, Chinese horology regressed and stagnated.

4. Printing. Printing was invented in China (which also invented paper) in the ninth century and found general use by the tenth. This achievement is the more impressive in that the Chinese language, which is written in ideographs (no alphabet), does not lend itself easily to movable type. That explains why Chinese printing consisted primarily of full-page block impressions; also why so much of the old Chinese texts consists of drawings. If one is going to cut a block, it is easier to draw than to carve a multitude of characters. Also, ideographic writing works against literacy: one may learn the characters as a child, but if one does not keep using them, one forgets how to read. Pictures helped. Block printing limits the range and diffusion of publication. It is well suited to the spread of classic and sacred texts, Buddhist mantras, and the like, but it increases the cost and risk of publishing newer work and tends to small printings. Some Chinese printers did use movable type, but given the character of the written language and the investment required, the technique never caught on as in the West. Indeed, like other Chinese inventions, it may well have been abandoned for a time, to be reintroduced later.8 In general, for all that printing did for the preservation and diffusion of knowledge in China, it never "exploded" as in Europe. Much publication depended on government initiative, and the Confucian mandarinate discouraged dissent and new ideas. Even evidence of the falsity of conventional knowledge could be dismissed as appearance

Europe came to printing centuries after China. It should not be thought, however, that printing made the book and invented reading. On the contrary, the interest in the written word grew rapidly in the Middle Ages, especially after bureaucracy and the rise of towns increased demand for records and documents. Government rests on paper. Much of this verbiage, moreover, was written in the vernacular, shattering the hieratic monopoly of a dead but sacred tongue (Latin) and opening the way to wider readership and a literature of dissent. As a result, scribes could not keep up with demand. All manner of arrangements were conceived to increase reading material. Manuscripts were prepared and bound in separable fascicles; that divided the labor of writing while enabling several people to read the book at the same time. And as in China, block printing came in before movable type, yielding flysheets more than books and once again copiously illustrated. So when Gutenberg published his Bible in 1452-55, the first Western book printed by movable type (and arguably the most beautiful book ever printed), he brought the new technique to a society that had already vasdy increased its output of writing and was fairly panting after it. Within the next half century, printing spread from the Rhineland throughout western Europe

In spite of printing's manifest advantages, it was not accepted everywhere. The Muslim countries long remained opposed, largely on religious grounds: the idea of a printed Koran was unacceptable. Jews and Christians had presses in Istanbul but not Muslims. The same in India: not until the early nineteenth century was the first press installed. In Europe, on the other hand, no one could put a lid on the new technology. Political authority was too fragmented. The Church had tried to curb vernacular translations of sacred writ and to forbid dissemination of both canonical and noncanonical texts. Now it was overwhelmed. The demons of heresy were out long before Luther, and printing made it impossible to get them back in the box

The Europeans, on the other hand, learned in the sixteenth century to "corn" their powder, making it in the form of small kernels or pebbles.

Islam, initially absorbed and developed the knowledge and ways of conquered peoples. By our period (roughly 1000 to 1500), Muslim rule went from the western end of the Mediterranean to the Indies. Before this, from about 750 to 1100, Islamic science and technology far surpassed those of Europe, which needed to recover its heritage and did so to some extent through contacts with Muslims in such frontier areas as Spain. Islam was Europe's teacher. Then something went wrong. Islamic science, denounced as heresy by religious zealots, bent under theological pressures for spiritual conformity. (For thinkers and searchers, this could be a matter of life and death.) For militant Islam, the truth had already been revealed. What led back to the truth was useful and permissible; all the rest was error and deceit

When the Muslims conquered Persia (637-642) and came upon an indescribably large number of books and scientific papers, Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas wrote to Umar bin al-Khattab asking him for permission to take them and distribute them as booty among the Muslims. On that occasion, Umar wrote him: "Throw them in the water. If what they contain is right guidance, God has given us better guidance. If it is error, God has protected us against it."1 5 Remember here that Islam does not, as Christianity does, separate the religious from the secular. The two constitute an integrated whole. The ideal state would be a theocracy; and in the absence of such fulfillment, a good ruler leaves matters of the spirit and mind (in the widest sense) to the doctors of the faith. This can be hard on scientists

The one civilization that might have surpassed the European achievement was China. At least that is what the record seems to show. Witness the long list of Chinese inventions: the wheelbarrow, the stirrup, the rigid horse collar (to prevent choking), the compass, paper, printing, gunpowder, porcelain. And yet in matters of science and technology, China remains a mystery—and this in spite of a monumental effort by the late Joseph Needham and others to collect the facts and clarify the issues. The specialists tell us, for example, that Chinese industry long anticipated European: in textiles, where the Chinese had a water-driven machine for spinning hemp in the twelfth century, some five hundred years before the England of the Industrial Revolution knew water frames and mules;1 7 or in iron manufacture, where the Chinese early learned to use coal and coke in blast furnaces for smelting iron (or so we are told) and were turning out as many as 125,000 tons of pig iron by the later eleventh century—a figure reached by Britain seven hundred years later.1 8 The mystery lies in China's failure to realize its potential. One generally assumes that knowledge and know-how are cumulative; surely a superior technique, once known, will replace older methods. But Chinese industrial history offers examples of technological oblivion and regression. We saw that horology went backward. Similarly, the machine to spin hemp was never adapted to the manufacture of cotton, and cotton spinning was never mechanized. And coal/coke smelting was allowed to fall into disuse, along with the iron industry as a whole

• The absence of a free market and institutionalized property rights. The Chinese state was always interfering with private enterprise—taking over lucrative activities, prohibiting others, manipulating prices, exacting bribes, curtailing private enrichment. A favorite target was maritime trade, which the Heavenly Kingdom saw as a diversion from imperial concerns, as a divisive force and source of income inequality, worse yet, as an invitation to exit. Matters reached a climax under the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), when the state attempted to prohibit all trade overseas. Such interdictions led to evasion and smuggling, and smuggling brought corruption (protection money), confiscations, violence, and punishment. Bad government strangled initiative, increased the cost of transactions, diverted talent from commerce and industry

The ingenuity and inventiveness of the Chinese, which have given so much to mankind—silk, tea, porcelain, paper, printing, and more—would no doubt have enriched China further and probably brought it to the threshold of modern industry, had it not been for this stifling state control. It is the State that kills technological progress in China. Not only in the sense that it nips in the bud anything that goes against or seems to go against its interests, but also by the customs implanted inexorably by the raison d'Etat. The atmosphere of routine, of traditionalism, and of immobility, which makes any innovation suspect, any initiative that is not commanded and sanctioned in advance, is unfavorable to the spirit of free inquiry.2 1 In short, no one was trying. Why try? Whatever the mix of factors, the result was a weird pattern of isolated initiatives and sisyphean discontinuities—up, up, up, and then down again—almost as though the society were held down by a silk ceiling. The result, if not the aim, was change-in-immobility; or maybe immobility-in-change. Innovation was allowed to go (was able to go) so far and no farther

if one understands by totalitarianism the complete hold of the State and its executive organs and functionaries over all the activities of social life, without exception, Chinese society was highly totalitarian. . . . N o private initiative, no expression of public life that can escape official control. There is to begin with a whole array of state monopolies, which comprise the great consumption staples: salt, iron, tea, alcohol, foreign trade. There is a monopoly of education, jealously guarded. There is practically a monopoly of letters (I was about to say, of the press): anything written unofficially, that escapes the censorship, has little hope of reaching the public. But the reach of the Moloch-State, the omnipotence of the bureaucracy, goes much farther. There are clothing regulations, a regulation of public and private construction (dimensions of houses); the colors one wears, the music one hears, the festivals—all are regulated. There are rules for birth and rules for death; the providential State watches minutely over every step of its subjects, from cradle to grave

the desire to free clerics from time-consuming earthly tasks led to the introduction and diffusion of power machinery and, beginning with the Cistercians, to the hiring of lay brothers (conversi) to do the dirty work. Employment fostered in turn attention to time and productivity. All of this gave rise on monastic estates to remarkable assemblages of powered machinery—complex sequences designed to make the most of the waterpower available and distribute it through a series of industrial operations.

Why this peculiarly European joie de trouver? This pleasure in new and better? This cultivation of invention—or what some have called "the invention of invention"? Different scholars have suggested a variety of reasons, typically related to religious values: 1. The Judeo-Christian respect for manual labor, summed up in a number of biblical injunctions. One example: When God warns Noah of the coming flood and tells him he will be saved, it is not God who saves him. "Build thee an ark of gopher wood," he says, and Noah builds an ark to divine specifications. 2. The Judeo-Christian subordination of nature to man. This is a sharp departure from widespread animistic beliefs and practices that saw something of the divine in every tree and stream (hence naiads and dryads). Ecologists today might think these animistic beliefs preferable

3. The Judeo-Christian sense of linear time. Other societies thought of time as cyclical, returning to earlier stages and starting over again. Linear time is progressive or regressive, moving on to better things or declining from some earlier, happier state. For Europeans in our period, the progressive view prevailed. 4. In the last analysis, however, I would stress the market. Enterprise was free in Europe. Innovation worked and paid, and rulers and vested interests were limited in their ability to prevent or discourage innovation. Success bred imitation and emulation; also a sense of power that would in the long run raise men almost to the level of gods. The old legends remained—the expulsion from the Garden, Icarus who flew too high, Prometheus in chains—to warn against hubris. (The very notion of hubris—cosmic insolence—is testimony to some men's pretensions and the efforts of others to curb them.) But the doers were not paying attention

In the tenth century, Europe was just coming out of a long torment of invasion, plunder, and rapine, by enemies from all sides. From what we now know as Scandinavia, the Norsemen or Vikings, marine bandits whose light boats could handle the roughest seas and yet sail up shallow rivers to raid and pillage far inland, struck along the Atlantic coasts and into the Mediterranean as far as Italy and Sicily. Others went east into Slavic lands, establishing themselves as a new ruling class (the Rus, who gave their name to Russia and ruled that somber land for some seven hundred years), and eventually penetrating almost to the walls of Constantinople. So terrifying were these marauders, so ruthless their tactics (taking pleasure in tossing babes in the air and catching them on their lances, or smashing their heads against the wall), that the very rumor of their

arrival loosened the limbs and loins of the population and sent their leaders, including their spiritual guides, in headlong flight, carrying their movable wealth with them. The clerics did leave their parishioners some newly composed prayers for protection by the Almighty, but the altar was not a good refuge, for the Vikings knew where the plunder lay and headed straight for churches and casdes. Also coming from the sea, across the Mediterranean, were Saracens (Moors), who set up mountain bases in the Alps and on the Côte d'Azur, and went out from these to raid the trade routes between northern and southern Europe. These fastnesses, hard of access and yet linked to Muslim lands by the sea, were inexpugnable, and folk legend has it that to this day some villagers in the high Alps carry the color and appearance of their Maghrébin origins. Finally, from the east overland, but highly mobile for all that, rode the Magyars or Hungarians, one more wave of invaders from Asia, pagans speaking a Ural-Altaic language (a distant cousin of Turkish), sweeping in year after year, choosing their targets by news of European dissensions and dynastic troubles, swift enough to move in a single campaign from their Danubian bases into eastern France or the foot of Italy. Unlike the Norsemen, who were ready to settle into base camps for a period of years, the better to hunt and find, or who even established themselves quasi-permanently as rulers in part of England, in Normandy (which took their name), and in Sicily, the Hungarians went out and back, hauling their booty and slaves along with them in wagons or on pack animals. N o one will submit to that kind of abuse indefinitely. The Europeans learned to counter these thrusts, with or without the help of their leaders, who were only too quick to make their own deals with the invaders on the backs of their peasants. Instead of trying to keep the Norsemen out, the villagers let them in, trapped them, fell on them from all sides.* The Hungarians, too swift to deal with when they came in, were slow going out; a few ambushes of the overproud, overloaded trains convinced them that there must be better ways to make a living. As for the Saracens, the solution lay, as in Muslim lands, in military escorts for mule and wagon trains (caravans). In short, the Europeans raised the price of aggression. In all these instances, ironically, the Europeans were assisted by enemy headquarters

Kingdoms replaced nomadic war camps, and their rulers looked with disfavor on these swaggering "captains," with their private armies and tales of derring-do, returning from their raids with booty and brags, and threatening the peace.

It has been suggested that this end to danger from without launched Europe on the path of growth and development. This is the classical economists' view: increase is natural and will occur wherever opportunity and security exist. Remove the obstacles, and growth will take care of itself. Others would argue that freedom from aggression is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Growth and development call for enterprise, and enterprise is not to be taken for granted. Besides, medieval Europe did not lack for impediments to such initiatives. To get an idea of the larger character of this process, one has to see the Middle Ages as the bridge between an ancient world set in the Mediterranean—Greece and then Rome—and a modern Europe north of the Alps and Pyrenees. In those middle years a new society was born, very different from what had gone before, and took a path that set it decisively apart from other civilizations. To be sure, Europe had always thought of itself as different from the societies to the east. The great battles between Greeks and Persians— Salamis, Thermopylae—have come down in folk memory and in the classes of yesteryear as symbolic of the combat between West and East, between the free city (the polis, which gives us our word "politics") and aristocratic empires,1 between popular sovereignty (at least for free men) and oriental despotism (servitude for all). In those days one was taught that the Greeks invented democracy, the word and the idea. This is still the conventional wisdom, though substantially modified by an awareness of Greek slavery and of their exclusion of women from the political process (though not from public space

Linked to the opposition between Greek democracy and oriental despotism was that between private property and ruler-owns-all. Indeed, that was the salient characteristic of despotism, that the ruler, who was viewed as a god or as partaking of the divine, thus different from and far above his subjects, could do as he pleased with their lives and things, which they held at his pleasure. And what was true for the ruler was true for his henchmen. The martial aristocracy typically had a monopoly of weapons, and ordinary folk were careful not to offend

Today, of course, we recognize that such contingency of ownership stifles enterprise and stunts development; for why should anyone invest capital or labor in the creation or acquisition of wealth that he may not be allowed to keep? In the words of Edmund Burke, "a law against property is a law against industry."2 In Asian despotisms, however, such arrangements were seen as the very raison d'être of human society: what did ordinary people exist for, except to enhance the pleasure of their rulers?

the very notion of economic development was a Western invention. Aristocratic (despotic) empires were characteristically squeeze operations: when the elites wanted more, they did not think in terms of gains in productivity. Where would these have come from? They simply pressed (and oppressed) harder, and usually found some hidden juice. Sometimes they miscalculated and squeezed too hard, and that could mean flight, riot, and opportunities for rebellion. These autocracies, though defined as divine, were not immortal.

In China, even when the state did not take, it oversaw, regulated, and repressed. Authority should not have to depend on goodwill, the right attitude, personal virtue. Three hundred years before the Common Era, a Chinese moralist was telling a prince how to rule, not by winning the affection of his subjects but by ensuring their obedience. A prince cannot see and hear everything, so he must turn the entire empire into his eyes and ears. "Though he may live in the deepest retreat of his palace, at the end of tortuous corridors, nothing escapes him, nothing is hidden from him, nothing can escape his vigilant watch."5 Such a system depends on the honesty and capacity of the living eyes and ears. The ruler is at the mercy of ambitious subordinates, whose capacity for deception and hypocrisy is unbounded. The weakness of autocracy is in the human raw material. Fortunately

Cities of course were to be found around the world—wherever agriculture produced sufficient surplus to sustain a population of rulers, soldiers, craftsmen, and other nonfood producers. Many of these urban nodes came to acquire great importance as markets, to say nothing of their role as administrative centers. But nothing like the commune appeared outside western Europe.9 The essence of the commune lay, first, in its economic function: these units were "governments of the merchants, by the merchants, and for the merchants";1 0 and second, in its exceptional civil power: its ability to confer social status and political rights on its residents—rights crucial to the conduct of business and to freedom from outside interference. This meant everything in a hierarchical, agrarian society that held most of the population in thrall, either by personal dependence on local lords or ties to place. It made the cities gateways to freedom,

Migration to cities improved the income and status not only of the migrants but of those left behind. (But not their health. The cities were dirty, crowded, and lent themselves to easy contagion, so that it was only in-migration that sustained their numbers and enabled them to grow. ) Serf emancipation in western Europe was directly linked to the rash of franchised villages and urban communes, and to the density and proximity of these gateways. Where cities and towns were few and unfree, as in eastern Europe, serfdom persisted and worsened. Why did rulers grant such rights to rustics and townsmen, in effect abandoning (transferring) some of their own powers? Two reasons above all. First, new land, new crops, trade, and markets brought revenue, and revenue brought power.1 1 (Also pleasure.) Second, paradoxically, rulers wanted to enhance their power within their own kingdom: free farmers (note that I do not say "peasants") and townsmen (bourgeois) were the natural enemies of the landed aristocracy and would support the crown and other great lords in their struggles with local seigneurs

European rulers and enterprising lords who sought to grow revenues in this manner had to attract participants by the grant of franchises, freedoms, and privileges—in short, by making deals. They had to persuade them to come.1 2 (That was not the way in China, where rulers moved thousands and tens of thousands of human cattle and planted them on the soil, the better to grow things.) These exemptions from material burdens and grants of economic privilege, moreover, often led to political concessions and self-government. Here the initiative came from below, and this too was an essentially European pattern

Is fragmentation and federalism the key to competitive growth within a nation state? A centralised structure gives way to tyranny and authotarianism whereas a more federal autonomous structure creates natural interdependednce while at the same time allowing citizens to vote with their feet and move to friendlier locations within a nation. This could probably result in a more dynamic nation which is innovating constantly

642). Also Aztec Mexico and Inca Peru. Europe, in contrast, did not have all its eggs in one basket.* In the thirteenth century the Mongol invaders from the Asian steppe made short work of the Slavic and Khazar kingdoms of what is now Russia and Ukraine, but they still had to cut their way through an array of central European states, including the new kingdoms of their predecessors in invasion—the Poles, Lithuanians, Germans, Hungarians, and Bulgare—before they could even begin to confront the successor states of the Roman empire. This they might well have done had they not been distracted by troubles back home; but they would have paid dearly for further gains, especially in forested areas. Shortly thereafter the Turks, who had established themselves in Anatolia, began to expand into Europe, conquering the Balkans, then the lower Danube Valley, and getting twice to the walls of Vienna, capital of Germany's eastern march. In the course of these advances, they subdued the Serbs, the Bulgars, the Croats, the Slovenes, the Albanians, the Hungarians, and sundry other peoples of that confused and quarrelsome palimpsest. But that was it; by the time they got to Vienna, they had reached the limit of their resources.1 Part of the brittleness of these empires, of course, derived from their exploitative, surplus-sucking character and the indifference of subjects to the identity of their rulers: one despot was the same as the next; one foreign clan as arrogant and predatory as another. Why should the inhabitants of Persia care what happened to Darius at the hands of Alexander? Or what happened nine hundred years later to the Sassanian monarchy at the hands of the Arabs? Why should the tired, oppressed Roman "citizens" of the last days of empire care whether Rome fell? Or the subject tribes of Mexico, for that matter, care what happened to Moctezuma

Time and money were on the side of order. So was the diversion of brawlers to external frontiers (cf. the Crusades). The economist would say that once the exogenous shocks ended, the system could take care of its endogenous troublemakers. There ensued a long period of population increase and economic growth, up to the middle of the fourteenth century, when Europeans were smitten by the plague (the "Black Death") in its bubonic and pneumonic forms and a third or more of the people died; a half when you count the losses inflicted by sequellae. That was a jolt, but not a full stop. The one hundred fifty years that followed were a period of rebuilding, further technological advance, and continued development. In particular, these centuries saw the further expansion of a civilization that now found itself stronger than its neighbors, and the beginnings of exploration and conquest overseas

This long multicentennial maturation (1000-1500) rested on an economic revolution, a transformation of the entire process of making, getting, and spending such as the world had not seen since the socalled Neolithic revolution. That one (c. - 8 0 0 0 to - 3 0 0 0 ) had taken thousands of years to work itself out. Its focus had been the invention of agriculture and the domestication of livestock, both of which had enormously augmented the energy available for work.

The medieval economic revolution also built on gains in the production and application of energy and concomitant increases in work. First, food supply: this was a period of innovation in the techniques of cultivation. I say innovation rather than invention because these new techniques went back earlier. Thus the wheeled plow, with deepcutting iron share, had come in with the German invaders; but it had seen limited use in a world of limited animal power and low population density. Now it spread across Europe north of the Loire, opened up the rich river valleys, turned land reclaimed from forest and sea into fertile fields, in short did wonders wherever the heavy, clayey soil resisted the older Roman wooden scratch plow, which had worked well enough on the gravelly soils of the Mediterranean basin. The wheeled plow turning heavy soil called for animals to match. We have already had occasion to speak of these big, stall-fed oxen such as were found nowhere else, and these large dray horses, more powerful if not stronger than the ox. These living, mobile engines offered a great advantage in a land-rich, labor-scarce economy. For time too was scarce: agricultural work has peaks of activity at sowing and harvest when one must seize good weather and get the seed in or crops out. Especially was this true of European communal agriculture, where scattered and intermingled holdings and open fields made for much toand-fro and one peasant's haste was the haste of all his neighbors. Strong, quick animals could make all the difference, and cultivators pooled resources to get the right livestock

a shift from a two-field (one half left fallow every year) to a three-field system of crop rotation (winter grain, spring grain, and one third fallow). This yielded a gain of one third in land productivity (one sixth of total cultivable land, but one third of the half previously under cultivation), which further contributed to the ability to support livestock, which increased the supply of fertilizer, which nourished yields, and so on in ascending cycle. Given the character of land distribution and the collective use of draft animals, this critical change called for strong communal leadership and cooperation, made easier by example and results

But it would seem that over time, population began to outstrip the means of sustenance, because these centuries also saw a great effort to increase arable, whether by forest clearing (assarts) or reclamation of land from water, by diking, drainage, and pumping. All these call for enormous energy and capital, and their success testifies not only to private and collective initiative but to the ingenuity of a society that was learning to substitute machines for animal and human power. In particular, the windmill, tireless and faithful, was the key to the successful pumping of fens and polders. It was the windmill that made Holland

It was the urban minority that held most of the seeds and secrets of transformation—technical, intellectual, political. To be sure, the towns and cities were themselves shaped by the countryside: immigrants from the fields brought with them values, habits, and attitudes that made more sense on the land and then set them as a straitjacket on urban activity. Thus the organization of tradesmen and craftsmen in corporate guilds assumed a zero-sum game—one man's increase was another's diminution—like pieces in a bounded field. Besides, the urban setting itself made it necessary to ration space and time, again with an eye to discouraging self-aggrandizement. So, no stealing a march and selling before a certain hour or after another; no price competition; no trade-off of quality and solidity for cheapness; no buying low ("jewing down," in popular parlance—bad habits always belong to someone else) to sell high; in short, no market competition. Everyone who did his job was entitled to a living. Laudable but static. The aim was an egalitarian social justice, but it entailed serious constraint on enterprise and growth—a safety net at the expense of income

So in medieval Europe, where the move toward guild controls was as much a response to free dealing as the expression of an older morality. Cities and towns sprang up thick and ambitious; in France, the Low Countries, the Rhineland, rulers encouraged them by generous grants of privilege. But attempts to sustain local monopoly were thwarted by the growth of suburbs (faubourgs), where urban rules did not apply

One inevitable consequence of active trade was selection by merit. This ran against the parity principle (equality of results), but it was not possible to impose uniformity of performance. Some craftsmen simply did better work and attracted buyers beyond their capacity. At the same time, the very effort to restrain competition by limiting access to mastership meant talent unemployed. It did not take much to bring together such masters and journeymen. Since the journeymen were often not permitted to work in the master's city shop (limits on size), they worked en chambre or in the suburbs. Here was the beginning of putting-out and division of labor, with substantial gains in productivity

Early on (thirteenth century), then, merchants began to hire cottage workers to perform some of the more tedious, less skilled tasks. In the most important branch, the textile manufacture, peasant women did the spinning on a putting-out basis: merchants gave out (put out) the raw material—the raw wool and flax, and, later, cotton—and collected the finished yarn. This shift to outsourcing initially encountered little resistance from urban workers; but when merchants started putting-out yarn to cottage weavers, they were attacking one of the most powerful vested interests of the day, the guild weavers of the towns. Then the fat was in the fire. In Italy, the autonomous cities, which held political control over the surrounding countryside, managed to destroy much of this "unfair" competition. In the Low Countries, the other great medieval center of cloth manufacture, urban weavers marched into the villages to break cottage looms; and although the country weavers fought back, the putting-out system was held in check for centuries

The one country where putting-out had a free field was England, where local political autonomies made it hard for the monarchy to sustain corporate (guild) claims to monopoly and where guilds were quickly reduced to ceremonial fraternities. By the fifteenth century, more than half the nation's woolen cloth was being made in rural cottages. This recourse to cheap labor lowered costs over competitors abroad, so that by the sixteenth century a country that had once been largely an exporter of pri

Almost all of this "commercial revolution" came from the mercantile community, bypassing where necessary the rules of this or that city or state, inventing and improvising new venues for encounter and exchange (ports and outports, faubourgs, local markets, international fairs), creating in short a world of its own like an overlay on the convoluted, inconvenient mosaic of political units. They got thereby substantially enhanced security, a sharp reduction in the cost of doing business (what the economist calls "transaction costs"), a widening of the market that promoted specialization and division of labor. It was the world of Adam Smith, already taking shape five hundred years before his time

Even in winter, West European temperatures are kind. If one traces lines of equal temperature around the globe (isotherms), nowhere do they bend so far north as along Europe's Atlantic coast. The mean winter temperature in coastal Norway, north latitude 58 to 71 degrees, exceeds that in Vermont or Ohio, some 20 degrees closer to the equator. As a result, Europeans were able to grow crops year round. They were assisted here by a relatively even rainfall pattern, distributed around the year and rarely torrential

This dependable and equable supply of water made for a different pattern of social and political organization from that prevailing in riverine civilizations. Along rivers, control of food fell inevitably to those who held the stream and the canals it fed. Centralized government appeared early, because the master of food was master of people. (The biblical account of Joseph and Pharaoh tells this process in allegory. In order to get food, the starving Egyptians gave up to Pharaoh first their money, then their livestock, then their land, then their persons [Genesis 47:13-22].)

This privileged European climate was the gift of the large warm current that we know as the Gulf Stream, rising in tropical waters off Africa, working its way westward across the Atlantic and through the Caribbean, then recrossing the Atlantic in a generally northeast direction. The clockwise rotation is produced by the spin of the earth in combination with water rising as it warms; in the southern hemisphere, equatorial currents go counterclockwise (see Map 1). In both hemispheres, equatorial currents proceed from east to west, bearing heat and rich marine life with them

This accident: the shape taken by South America as tectonic continental plates parted and the Americas broke off from the African landmass, specifically, the great eastward bulge of Brazil (roughly corresponding to the eastward bend in the Atlantic coast of Africa). Brazil's salient splits the south equatorial current and sends roughly half of it northward to join its northern counterpart, producing a huge warm-water mass that washes finally against the coasts of Ireland and Norway (see Map 1).

along the Atlantic, there where the moistureladen west winds leave the water for land. As one moves east toward the Polish and Russian steppe, climate becomes more "continental," with wider extremes of both moisture and temperature. The same for the Mediterranean lands: the temperatures are kind, but rain is sparser, more uneven. In Spain, Portugal, southern Italy, and Greece, the soil yields less, olive trees and grapes do better than cereals, pasture pays more than agriculture. Some would argue that these geographical handicaps led to poverty, even to industrial retardation, in southern as against northern Europe.1 (We shall see later that other, cultural reasons may have been at least as important.

Not until people had iron cutting tools, in the first millennium before our era (B.C.E.), could they clear those otherwise fertile plains north of the Alps. N o accident, then, that settlement of what was to become Europe took place first along lakeshores (what we know as lacustrine settlements, often on stilts) and on grasslands— not necessarily the most fertile lands, but the ones accessible to primitive, nonferrous technology. Only later could Europe grow enough food to sustain denser populations and the surpluses that support urban centers of cultural exchange and development. Even so, most of the forest remained, even gaining when population shrank in the centuries following the fall of Rome.

Europe knew famine and disease, long waves of cooling and warming, epidemics and pandemics. Peasants knew they could survive one and perhaps two bad crops, but after that came starvation. Here again the forest played a crucial role— source of berries, nuts, even acorns and chestnuts. And here too the steady water meant that farming was not marginal, that a dry spell would soon be followed by a return of rain and crops. One has to look at the dry places, there where cultivation is a gamble and the land risks turning into desert—not only the areas south of the invasive Sahara, or the lands east of the Jordan River on the northern margin of the Arabian desert, but the American plains west of the 100th meridian

This favorable environment enabled Europeans to leave more of the land for forest and fallow and so raise livestock without seeking far for pasture. Their animals were bigger and stronger than those of other lands. The Mongolian pony, scourge of the steppe, stood tiny next to a European battle steed; the same for Arab mounts. Much of India could not breed horses at all because of the climate. Yet both small and large animals offered advantages. The Mongol and Tartar could move easily across their empty inland sea, striking fast and hard against the sedentary populations round.

In 732, Charles Martel, grandfather of Charlemagne and Frankish Mayor of the Palace, led an army of mounted knights against the Arab invaders near Tours and set a westward limit to what had seemed irresistible Muslim expansion.* Some four hundred fifty years later, in 1187, the Saracen troops of Saladin let the European knights charge down at them at the Horns of Hattin, stepping aside at the last moment to let them through. By then the crusader mounts, which had been carrying their riders all day in the blazing sun, were exhausted. The Saracens had only to close and cut down the Europeans from the rear. So ended the crusading kingdom of Jerusalem and Christian feudal power in the Holy Land.

In the long run, however, the Europeans won. Larger animals meant an advantage in heavy work and transport. Dray horses could plow the clayey soils of the great northern plain (the horse is more powerful than the ox, that is, it moves faster and does more work in less time), while moving fresh crops to urban markets. Later on they would haul field guns to war and into combat. European herds were typically larger and yielded lots of animal fertilizer (as against the human night soil employed in East Asia). This enabled more intensive cultivation and larger crops, which gave more feed, and so on in an upward spiral. As a result, Europeans kept a diet rich in dairy products, meat, and animal proteins. They grew taller and stronger

The gains from animal fertilizer, plowing (which brings nutrients up from below), and fallow could not match the fertile silt of the Nile, the Euphrates, or the Indus; even less, the alluvial deposits of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, and the multiple cropping made possible by year-round warmth.** On the other hand, irregular interruptions in riverine cultivation, whether by want or excess of water or by enemy action against irrigation systems, could hurt far more than dry or wet spells in a rainy climate.* Averages are deceiving. Monsoon rains, generous over time, vary a lot from season to season and year to year. Floods and droughts are the norm. In China and India, repair and replenishment were that much more urgent. Even without catastrophe, the demand for labor in the rainy season and the big yields of wet cultivation promoted high densities of population—

Christian and especially western Europe accepted celibacy, late marriage (not until one could afford it), and more widely spaced births. Medieval Europeans saw children as a potential burden in time of need. Recall the stories of Hansel and Gretel and Tom Thumb—the children left in the forest to die far from the eyes of their parents. The riverine civilizations maximized population; the Europeans focused on small households and strategies of undivided inheritance and interfamilial alliance

Where conditions permitted, the Chinese went beyond this, over to rice gardening in submerged paddies. Taking quickergrowing varieties, they got three or more crops per year. To do this, they saved and applied every drop of dung and feces; weeded incessantly; and maximized land use by raising seedlings in nurseries (high density) and then transplanting the mature shoots (needing more space) to the rice fields. In economic terms, they substituted labor for land, using sixty and eighty persons per hectare where an American wheat farmer would use one, and obtaining yields double and triple the already good results achieved in dry farming—as much as 2,700 liters per hectare. At the maximum, a thousand people could live on the food produced by a square kilometer.

Philosophers easily linked environment with temperament (hence the long-standing contrast between cold and hot, between sober thoughtfulness on the one hand, ebullient pleasure seeking on the other); while the infant discipline of anthropology in the nineteenth century presumed to demonstrate the effects of geography on the distribution of merit and wisdom, invariably most abundant in the writer's own group.3 In our own day, the tables are sometimes reversed, and Afro-American mythmakers contrast happy, creative "sun people" with cold, inhuman "ice people."

Any debate on Soviet defence spending would produce a bewildering array of competing numbers, and in general, those who desired lower US defence spending favoured the lower estimates while those supporting a higher US defence budget plumped for the higher estimates. A further upward pressure on US defence spending throughout the Cold War came from the tendency of all three major armed services to engage in their own direct lobbying of Congress, often making the case for pet projects that the administration as a whole had decided against. But when it comes to over-egging a potential threat, there is a real risk that faulty intelligence – or intelligence too coloured by potential future budgetary settlements – risks bad decision-making.

Large-scale inter-state warfare between major powers is hard to imagine in the world of the twenty-first century. That is partially because of the norms of behaviour but also because of an awareness of the human and economic costs. But it is worth remembering how hard it was to imagine in the world of the early twentieth century too. Norman Angell, then a journalist and later a Member of Parliament, first published The Great Illusion in 1909 – initially as the less catchily titled Europe’s Optical Illusion. It was an instant bestseller which was translated into eleven languages. Written at a time of rising global tensions and with the European powers dividing into the two great power blocks that would fight the Great War, it was a careful study of the costs of modern warfare and the nature of an interconnected global world. The great illusion of the title was that nations could still profit from even successful warfare and conquest. The costs of war, argued Angell, were now so high that any war would herald an economic disaster and be over quickly. He was half right. The Great War was an economic disaster for almost every nation involved, but it did not end quickly. Much of Angell’s book is an argument on the interconnected nature of the global economy on the eve of the First World War. Financial markets, trade patterns and supply chains had become so interlinked and crossed so many borders that they could not be disentangled. This alone, Angell hoped, would help to safeguard against an outbreak of fighting. Global trade in 1914 was running at levels which would not be seen again until the 1980s. The total value of goods crossing borders, as a share of total global GDP, had risen from around 5 per cent in the 1840s to 14 per cent on the eve of the war. Global capital flows, mostly in the form of cross-border lending, had risen over the same period from around 7 per cent of global GDP to 20 per cent – again, a level that would not be reached again until the 1980s.

In December 1861, Spanish ships seized the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. The following month, British and French soldiers arrived to reinforce the Spanish position. Britain, Spain and France’s Tripartite Expedition was intended to enforce claims for repayment on a republican Mexican government which had defaulted on its international loans. In Europe, few batted an eyelid at this use of military power to enforce a debt contract. More than a century and a half later no one ever seriously suggests using armed forces to extract payments from countries which miss international bond payments. The norms have simply shifted over time. The bar for using military force, at least against a comparable state, is now much higher.

Two major turning points in the economic history of warfare have occurred over the last millennium. The first was the military revolution of the early modern world, which fundamentally changed the direct fiscal costs of wars. Spain could be a leading power in the sixteenth century with an army numbering in the tens of thousands, but needed 300,000 regulars backed by half a million militia to maintain its position by the 1650s. Armies became even larger after the French Revolution with its concept of the entire nation in arms and the levée en masse allowing it to put millions of soldiers into the field. This was an important stepping stone to the mass warfare of the twentieth century. As wars became ever larger, states – the key economic institution – had to evolve and change to fund them. What became the modern forms of taxation, of public borrowing and of the wider financial system really began to develop in the aftermath of the military revolution. That military revolution ushered in fiscal and financial revolutions which in turn helped to create an even wider economic revolution. The second turning point came later. In the nineteenth century warfare became even more destructive. While earlier wars had killed many people, the damage to property, buildings and infrastructure was generally limited. Cities were occasionally sacked after a siege, but they were rarely levelled by fighting. From the 1850s onwards the growth of high-explosive artillery shells saw wars starting to mean the devastation of a nation’s capital stock. Aerial bombing supercharged the trend. The victorious side before the early 1800s could generally hope to meet its costs by forcing the loser to pay, but by the twentieth century even the victors would usually be worse off as a result of the conflict.

The fundamental problem, and a repeated failing of the German general staff in the first half of the twentieth century, was a consistent approach of trying to find military solutions to grand strategic problems which did not have a simple military solution. The plans it drew up were often militarily sound, at least in the short term, but almost always ignored the wider political, diplomatic and, crucially, economic context. The now infamous Schlieffen Plan put into operation in 1914 was, in the words of one recent history, more of ‘an opening gambit’ than a real long-term plan for war. Germany’s strategic problem was that it faced powerful enemies to the west and to the east. There was no straightforward route out of this problem in purely military terms, but this did not stop the general staff from trying to find one. Its eventual answer was a rapid campaign to knock France out of any war before turning to face Russia. It essentially bet the house on a quick victory, and what is more, the plan to achieve this end involved violating Belgian neutrality with no real consideration of the fact that this would almost certainly be enough to bring Britain into the war. As the war progressed, the same sort of mistakes reappeared. The military solution to getting Britain out of the war was unrestricted submarine warfare. This not only failed to do its job militarily but actually brought the United States into the war. As the general staff assumed ever greater economic powers, it threw an unsustainable volume of resources towards serving direct military needs and eventually helped to collapse the entire German economy, the whole war effort and indeed even the regime of the Kaiser it was supposed to serve. In the Second World War it planned and carried out an almost entirely unnecessary invasion of the Netherlands with little thought given to the important role that shipping to that neutral neighbour had played in helping to keep the impact of the British blockade at bay, for a time, in the previous war. Despite later attempts by German generals to blame everything on Hitler, it went along with the plans for the ultimately catastrophic invasion of the USSR. In both of the total wars of the twentieth century the eventual victors pursued an ultimately successful grand strategy. One which integrated and traded off where necessary military and operational planning with economic factors and resources, diplomatic objectives, and one which kept at least a wary eye on domestic politics and the need to maintain civilian morale. This is how total wars, which are far more than simple military contests, are won. In the German case this was achieved in neither conflict.

In increasingly technical and larger-scale wars, where armies could be moved rapidly by rail and communicate by telegraph, the German system seemed to offer a route to producing the kind of highly trained, technically proficient professionals that wars now required, the kind of officers who could plan a large move by railway well in advance and solve many military problems before they were encountered in the field. This system was reasonably – by the standards of the nineteenth century at least – meritocratic and rewarded talent. It also took great pride in being, as much as possible, above politics and isolated from outside pressures. It was a system that worked very well indeed in the nineteenth century but which failed spectacularly in the total wars of the twentieth century.

Hamburg ranks alongside Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a terrifying example of the raw destructive power of bombing in total war. Between the nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century the nature of warfare changed, and with it, its costs. There is plenty of evidence that before the nineteenth century warfare might actually have helped economies to grow and income per head to rise. No one would seriously make that case any more.

Perhaps the most striking fact is that most underdeveloped countries lie in the tropical and semi-tropical zones, between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.

The world shows a wide range of temperatures and temperature patterns, reflecting location, altitude, and the declination of the sun. These differences directly affect the rhythm of activity of all species: in cold, northern winters, some animals simply curl up and hibernate; in hot, shadeless deserts, lizards and serpents seek the cool under rocks or under the earth itself. (That is why so many desert fauna are reptiles: reptiles are crawlers.) Mankind generally avoids the extremes. People pass, but do not stay; hence such names as the "Empty Quarter" in the Arabian desert. Only greed—the discovery of gold or petroleum—or the duties of scientific inquiry can overcome a rational repugnance for such hardship and justify the cost

In general the discomfort of heat exceeds that of cold.* We all know the fable of the sun and wind. One deals with cold by putting on clothing, by building or finding shelter, by making fire. These techniques go back tens of thousands of years and account for the early dispersion of humanity from an African origin to colder climes. Heat is another story.

Take the biggest killer worldwide: malaria. Before the discovery of microbic pathogens, physicians attributed "fevers" to marshy miasmas—wrong cause, but not an unreasonable inference from proximity. So the French in Algeria, appalled by losses to illness, undertook systematic drainage of swamps to get rid of bad air (malaria). These projects may or may not have cleared the air, but they certainly banished mosquitoes. Military deaths from malaria fell by 61 percent in the period 1846-48 to 1 8 6 2 - 6 6 , while morbidity fell even more sharply from the 1830s to the 1860s.1 3 Such measures, moreover, yielded beneficial side effects.

Water is another problem. Tropical areas generally average enough rainfall, but the timing is often irregular and unpredictable, the downpours anything but gentle. The drops are large; the rate of fall torrential. The averages mean nothing when one goes from one extreme to the other, from one year or season or one day to the next.2 1 In northern Nigeria, 90 percent of all rain falls in storms of over 25 mm. per hour; that makes half the average monthly rainfall at Kew Gardens, outside London. Java has heavier pours: a quarter of the annual rainfall comes down at 60 mm. per hour. In such climes, cultivation does not compete easily with jungle and rain forest: these treasure houses of biodiversity favor every species but man and his limited array of crops. The result is a kind of war that leaves both nature and man losers. Attempts to cut down valuable plants and timber take the form of wasteful, slashing hunts. Nor does the exuberance of the jungle offer a good clue to what is possible under cultivation. Clear and plant, and the unshaded sun beats down; heavy rains pelt the ground—their fall unbroken by leaves and branches—leach out soil nutrients, create a new kind of waste. If the soil is clayey, composed in large part of iron and aluminum oxides, sun plus rain bakes the ground into a hard coat of armor. Two or three years of crops are followed by an indefinite forced fallow. Newly cleared ground is rapidly abandoned, and soon the vines and tendrils choke the presumptuous dwellings and temples. Again towns cannot thrive, for they need to draw on food surpluses from surrounding areas. Urbanization in Africa today, often chaotic, rests heavily on food imports from abroad

One answer to irregular moisture is storage and irrigation; but this is countered in these regions by incredibly high rates of evaporation. In the Agra region of India, for example, rainfall exceeds the current needs of agriculture for only two months in the year, and the excess held in the soil in those wet months dries up in only three weeks. It is no accident, then, that settlement and civilization followed the rivers, which bring down water from catchment areas and with it an annual deposit of fertile soil: thus the Nile, the Indus, the Tigris and Euphrates. These centers of ancient civilization were first and foremost centers of nourishment

This book is about seven of the world’s great civilizations: ancient Athens, the Roman Republic and early empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, Song China, Renaissance Italy, the Dutch Republic and the Anglosphere. Why did I pick those? Because each of them exemplifies, in my understanding, what I think of as a golden age: a period with a large number of innovations that revolutionize many fields and sectors in a short period of time. A golden age is associated with a culture of optimism, which encourages people to explore new knowledge, experiment with new methods and technologies, and exchange the results with others. Its characteristics are cultural creativity, scientific discoveries, technological achievements and economic growth that stand out compared with what came before and after it, and compared with other contemporary cultures. Its result is a high average standard of living, which is usually the envy of others, often also of their heirs.

Therefore it takes a certain population density to create progress, and urban conglomerations are often particularly creative. Being open to the contributions of other civilizations is the quickest way of making use of more brains, which is the reason why these golden ages often appear at the crossroads of other cultures, and in every instance benefited greatly from the inspiration brought about by international trade, travel and migration.

We humans have two basic settings: we are traders and we are tribalists. Early humans prospered (relatively) because they ventured out to explore, experiment and exchange, and to discover new places, partners and knowledge. But sometimes they only survived their adventures because they were also acutely sensitive to risks, and instantly reacted to a potential threat by fighting or fleeing back to the familiar, their cave and their tribe.

Again and again, we see civilizations prosper when they embrace trade and experiments, but decline when they lose cultural self-confidence. When under threat, we often seek stability and predictability, shutting out that which is different and unpredictable. Unfortunately, this often makes the fear of disaster self-fulfilling, since those barriers limit access to other possibilities and restrict the adaptation and innovation that could have helped us deal with the threat. The problem with paralysing fear is that it has a tendency to paralyse.

every time history books record that a city was ‘sacked’, it means that thousands of civilians were raped, mutilated and disembowelled. This also tells us something about what mankind is capable of. That our ancestors got through this is testament to their greatness. Some ten thousand generations suffered horrors and hunger, and then suddenly, in the past ten generations, everything changed, to the extent that many of us today have started seeing peace, democratic liberties and a full stomach as a natural state.

In the origin stories of modern Europe, the Italian Renaissance between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries holds a privileged position. It is often seen as the very evidence of a natural continuity between the Judeo-Christian heritage and Graeco-Roman culture that sets Europe apart and, according to some, makes it superior.

it is ironic that the Italian Renaissance in fact emerged in opposition to the traditional Christian elite, and that much of the inspiration for it was provided by the Chinese, the Arabs and a pagan Graeco-Roman culture that the Christian Church had tried to extinguish. Merchants from north Italian cities came across these cultures on their travels, and one reason why Europe was so open to these influences was a palpable sense of inferiority. Poor, uneducated Europeans realized that they had everything to gain from the ideas and methods of more advanced civilizations.

After seventeen years in Asia, Marco Polo returned to Europe. Venice was at war with Genoa at the time, and Marco Polo was imprisoned by the Genoese. He started sharing his stories with a fellow inmate, who wrote them down and turned them into one of the few international bestsellers before the printing press. All over Europe, readers marvelled at his descriptions of a magical empire with vast transport networks, money made of paper, and ‘black stones’ that they dug up and burned instead of firewood. Even in decline after the end of the Song dynasty, China seemed so incredibly advanced and prosperous that many assumed that Marco Polo had made it all up (and not just the parts he did in fact make up – like Christians moving mountains with a prayer, and reporting himself as at a battle that actually took place before he left Italy). Visiting the old Song capital of Hangzhou, apparently fifteen times bigger than his native Venice, the thrilled Marco Polo described it as ‘the greatest city which may be found in the world, where so many pleasures may be found that one fancies oneself in paradise’.

The stories told by Marco Polo and other adventurers, and the exquisite silk, spices and porcelain imported, whetted the European appetite to set sail, to trade and to raid, but most of all to imitate. The insight that very large ships with multiple masts had been built, and could stay at sea for extended periods, spurred innovation. Medieval Europe suddenly started building ships with stern-post rudders instead of steering oars, which had offered almost no control in storms on the high seas. Europeans soon also fitted their vessels with three masts, to be able to deal with adverse winds, basically building the kinds of ship that were needed to go on journeys of discovery. With the extremely limited knowledge that Europeans had of the real China and its production methods, these stories mostly showed them that something different, richer and more exciting was possible and could be worth trying.

Italian trading ports such as Pisa had acquired huge collections of books captured during the Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

But, most importantly, in private and public libraries, they found all the books that they had heard rumours of but were never entirely sure existed: almost mythical works by Euclid, Galen, Archimedes, Averroes and Aristotle.

Among the most coveted spoils were Averroes’ writings, the Andalusian who had done so much to make Islam and Greek philosophy compatible. His extensive discussions of Aristotle made the ancient philosopher both accessible and attractive. In fact, the first time many of Aristotle’s texts became available was through the extracts in Averroes’ writings. The breadth and depth of Aristotelian ideas was awe-inspiring. His system for analysing and understanding the natural world, from plants and animals to the movement of the stars, though one and a half millennia old, was so far ahead of anything in Europe as to prove irresistible – or terrifying. The radical ideas were a sensation and enormously popular among young scholars. The idea that human reason and empirical study were the path to knowledge, and that we are not born to suffer in this world but to attain worldly happiness, set medieval minds aflame.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), who quoted Averroes some 500 times, would eventually convince the Church that it was possible to be an Aristotelian without being cut off from Christ. Aquinas’s life’s work was to make Aristotelianism compatible with Christianity, just as Averroes had done for Islam. Aquinas put the Renaissance foot in the medieval door, leaving room for curiosity to slip through.

In the 530s, the Byzantine emperor Justinian had ordered a massive compilation of Roman legal thinking. The Digest consisted of fifty books with extracts from the texts of Roman jurists on a wide variety of legal questions, civil, criminal and constitutional law. This collection of centuries of complex legal analysis, particularly its recognition of individual rights such as rights to life and private property, created a surge of interest in law. Its width and sophistication quickly made it seem like the ideal of law, and the question was only how to interpret and implement it. Universities were founded at least in part to study Roman law and apply logic to the body of law. What is often seen as the first European university, the university of Bologna, was started in 1088 when students came together to hire a teacher to educate them in law.

Under pressure from the papal ambitions and with the Digest as a guide, polities all over Western Europe developed autonomous bodies of law to organize their mass of inherited legal materials, and professional judges and practising lawyers emerged. All these new legal systems overlapped. Suddenly there was ecclesiastical law, royal law, feudal law and urban law. Fascinatingly, mercantile law was developed by merchants themselves, who started building a trans-national system of rules and mercantile courts to protect the rights of foreign visitors and merchants. The pluralism of law meant that people lived under several different legal systems and could sometimes appeal to another jurisdiction if they thought they had been wronged. It is another example of how norms and order often emerge from the bottom up rather than being imposed from the top.

In the Digest, scholars found the Roman maxim ‘What concerns everyone ought to be considered and approved by everyone.’ It was a Roman approach to dealing with testamentary disposition but was now wielded by some scholars as a broad proto-democratic principle, calling for the consent of the governed, something that would eventually give us rallying cries like ‘no taxation without representation’. European scholars might have thought that they had simply restated Roman law, but they had in fact used Greek logic to analyse and systematize Roman legal practice into a new, radical constitutional principle that did not exist previously. It would have appalled Justinian, who preferred the opposite idea, written down in his teaching handbook and not in the collection of Roman law: ‘What pleases the prince has the force of law.’ The political battles in Europe over the next centuries would revolve around the battle between these two principles.

The Italian peninsula, hilly with long coastlines and located between northern Europe and the Middle East, was made for seafaring and commerce. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, cities like Venice, Pisa, Genoa, Florence and Siena gained prosperity and confidence through economic exchange with the Byzantines and Arab states. The wealth they brought in seeped inland, and new cities and suburbs grew rapidly. New middle classes emerged and often began to elect their own magistrates. Venice had been founded by refugees from the Roman Empire fleeing the barbarian invasions, and as Byzantine power declined, they declared independence. After having mastered the tricky currents of the Adriatic Sea, the Venetians turned their marshy lagoon into a commercial centre. When the pope objected to their economic relationship with Syria and Egypt, they replied: ‘We are Venetians first and only then Christians.’

Chinese cities had never developed a separate civic culture and independence. The Chinese countryside was already so commercialized that cities were closely integrated into the whole economy, and the unified imperial structure did not allow for audacious cities to go their own way. Cities in the more fragmented Western Europe were different: islands of refuge and independence in oceans of feudalism and serfdom. Italian cities did not abstain from mostly small-scale wars between themselves, but many political battles were also morphed into legal questions. Instead of always taking up arms, they often solved disputes by consulting the Justinian Digest.

In growing cities where at least the upper class and guilds governed themselves, there was a tremendous growth in communal organizations such as universities, confraternities and corporate economic associations. It didn’t hurt these new urban ideals that Aristotle’s Politics appeared in Latin translation in 1265, a treatise where the city-state is seen as the model. Banks – named after the banki (benches) they were seated at to do business – sprang up to fund risky international trade, sometimes with ‘credit’ facilities (from the Latin for ‘to trust’). Commerce was facilitated by new financial tools like double-entry bookkeeping, joint stock companies, insurance, bills of exchange and a systematized foreign exchange market. It’s no coincidence that, among English words of Italian or Latin origin, many are related to business: bank, bankrupt, carat, career, cartel, cash, credit, mercantile, management and net.

great libertarian theorist Tom G. Palmer summarizing world history in one sentence during a lecture. Out of his virtuoso knowledge of human societies and institutions, he chose, only half-jokingly: ‘The lesson from history is: don’t get invaded by Mongols.’ Both the Abbasid Caliphate and Song China were devastated by the Mongols, and so was much of the rest of Eurasia. In the early 1240s, Europe’s turn came. In December 1241, a siege of Kiev in eastern Europe ended with the city’s fall, and the much smaller city of Moscow was burned down. It established Mongol domination over Russia for 250 years, and their armies were free to advance westwards. In quick succession, Mongol armies defeated Poland and Hungary, which were said to have been turned into a barren wasteland. They then marched on to German territories, and soon some troops reached north-east Italy and the outskirts of Vienna. In one of his many history books, Winston Churchill wrote: ‘it had seemed as if all Europe would succumb to a terrible menace’.22 But then, in September 1242, the Mongols suddenly turned around and rode back home. It was a miracle. Many Europeans thought that God had answered their prayers. The traditional explanation is that the Mongols had received news that their ruler, Ögedei Khan, Genghis’s son, had died, and they now had to assemble in Mongolia to choose who to elect as successor. Other reasons for their sudden retreat have been suggested, from muddy terrain to fierce resistance, and it might simply be that the Mongols were disappointed with the modest loot on a continent that was still very poor compared with the great civilizations of the Middle East and Asia.

In the fourteenth century, the era of the humanists began. The newly empowered cities and an increasingly worldly Church were in need of scholars who could administer secular matters and argue over the newly discovered body of law. This spurred literacy and social mobility. It has been estimated that around half of all Italian city-dwellers were literate. Furthermore, the fragmentation of power and the new fortunes created meant that there was a growing group of potential patrons for scholars, who often moved between cities and between secular authorities and the papal bureaucracy to get funding for their work.

These thinkers, who often came from humble families and mostly started their careers with legal studies, lived in a world that was being radically transformed by pagan philosophy. Aristotelian ideas had been condemned time and again, but always found a new home in the archipelago of independent cities, universities and mobile scholars. In 1323, Thomas Aquinas, the controversial protagonist of a Christian Aristotelianism, was canonized by the pope, and from then on, Christendom increasingly saw the world as a beautiful place that could be understood through reason, logic and the evidence of the senses, and not just a vale of tears where we suffer and die, preparing for afterlife. The European barbarians would, as it were, become Greek. The ‘humanists’ of the Renaissance were scholars who were interested in human endeavours, rather than theology and metaphysics. They concerned themselves with the possibilities in this life, its activities and pleasures, rather than life after death. This does not mean that they were proto-atheists – most of them were deeply religious – they were just more interested in the affairs of men than gods. And, when they talked of gods, it often happened to be Apollo.

The Italian humanists also had something others didn’t to the same extent: they were surrounded by overgrown ruins that were a stark reminder of a lost golden age. Every day, Italians walked past the remnants of buildings made of material they could not reproduce, and constructed in ways they could not comprehend. In once-mighty Rome, the only viable industry seemed to be scavenging for material among old ruins. For some, these ruins reinforced the Augustinian belief that the world had been in a state of decay since the fall of man. But others instead became obsessed with the idea of restoring and recovering something exceptional that had been lost. The Tuscan poet Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374) mocked successive popes for having abandoned Rome for Avignon in France (for protection and to escape turmoil in Rome), where they spent their days drinking bad wine. He wanted them to return to Rome to signal a rebirth of the city. Petrarch was a hero of the humanists. He ‘restored Apollo to his ancient temple and brought back the Muses, soiled by rusticity,

it was a race against the clock to find ancient works before they were lost forever, and Petrarch led the search. In June 1345, he made his greatest discovery in the cathedral of Verona, one that would set Renaissance minds ablaze.

Through Cicero’s letters, humanists had their first eyewitness account of the late Roman Republic and its fall, and for recently independent republics it was deeply fascinating and created an interest in the study of history itself. But the letters also spurred an interest in individuality. Cicero, whose Latin was always considered the model, had been seen as something of a superhero but, in these letters, he came across as a real human being, with ambitions, emotions and anxieties, and with a very active involvement in society and politics.

Around 10.8 million manuscripts were hand-copied in Western Europe in the thousand years between the fall of Rome and 1500. And 4.9 million of those manuscripts, almost half, were produced during the 1400s, 1.4 million of which were produced in Italy.

Most early humanists were surprisingly uninterested in the natural sciences and often belittled fields like medicine, physics and astronomy. However, their questioning of authorities and encouragement of open debate would encourage the next generation of scientists. The only way to move research forward was to challenge one’s predecessors,

Modern writers love to mock Cicero for coming across as ambitious, vain and conceited in the letters he left us. Since other ancients did not open their hearts to us, they appear more dignified. Renaissance humanists felt differently, however. They were intrigued by Cicero’s self-centred approach; it seemed exciting in an age when one was supposed to think of oneself only as a humble part of the ‘Great Chain of Being’, the hierarchical model of the universe. Some began to imitate Cicero’s approach. Petrarch wrote about his own activities, interests and looks, his love of dogs and fear of ocean travel. The word ‘ego’ figures prominently in his writings. People started writing diaries and more personal autobiographies. In their letters they wrote about how to deal with their patrons and market their books, and documented their feelings when reading, how they laughed and cried and evaluated texts. When nineteenth-century historians talked about the Renaissance as the birth of the individual, this is what they meant. In his 1860 study The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, Jacob

The influential painter and art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that ‘Rivalry and competition, by which a man seeks by great works to conquer and overcome those more distinguished than himself in order to acquire honour and glory, is a praiseworthy thing.’32 So if you’re fed up with the rat race, you are somewhat justified in blaming the Renaissance. On the other hand, the elite had always competed for glory; the difference was that they were now less inclined to do it by taking to horseback and mowing down as many peasants as possible, and more by producing and trading ideas, texts, textiles, pottery and great works of art. A Venetian fourteenth-century innovation contributed to this individualism: the glass mirror. The old, expensive bronze mirrors did not reflect much light, which is why the Bible uses the mirror as a metaphor for not seeing the whole truth (‘For now we see in a mirror, darkly’). Venetian glass mirrors, coated with a mixture of tin and mercury, made it possible for those who could afford them to stare into their own eyes for the first time. They could see their unique characteristics and expressions, and they began to understand how others saw them. A song about mirrors in sixteenth-century Florence expresses the sentiment: ‘So a man can take his own measure and say, “I will be a better man than I have been.”’33 Historians like Ian Mortimer think that the mirror changed our very psychology. People started to think of themselves as unique, not just as part of a group. This is the moment when people began to order portraits of themselves, and artists started making self-portraits. Letters were increasingly filled with expressions of thoughts and feelings, rather than just accounts of activities or formalities and requests.

In 1347, Genoese traders returning from the Mongol siege of Crimea brought the Black Death to Europe. The bubonic plague quickly spread over the continent and killed more than a third of Europe’s population: according to some estimates, up to 60 per cent of all Europeans. To many it seemed like the end of the world. It was, at the very least, the end of the old world. The rigid feudal order, where everybody had a particular place inherited from their parents, was severely shaken. A large part of the population was suddenly gone, leaving positions and land open to those who remained. With the workforce decimated, peasants began to demand higher wages and moved to other areas with more opportunities.

The capital of the Renaissance was Florence, which in the eyes of Voltaire became ‘a second Athens’.35 This major Tuscan city had no pope, no king and it didn’t even have a large, prestigious university. It was a self-described republic, restoring the Roman ideal of a government held by the people in common, not by a single ruler. Instead of a spectacular court or dominant intellectual tradition, it had endless debates and controversies.

Even the great enemy of Christendom, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II who conquered Constantinople in 1453, hired Italian and Greek scholars and artists at his court, who spoke to him in Latin and Greek, and built a library filled with such literature. However, his invasion also meant that many scholars fled from Constantinople to Italy, thereby giving a boost to Greek learning there. Meanwhile, Rome was being rebuilt as a Renaissance city. In 1378, the pope had finally given up on Avignon and its bad wine and returned the papacy to Rome. When the University of Rome was restored, Leonardo Bruni wrote the statues, calling for a full programme of studies including the teaching of Greek. The humanist Alberti inspired the architectural plans for the city.

Raphael from Urbino (1483–1520) was commissioned to paint frescos for the reception rooms of the Apostolic Palace. On the east wall of the Room of the Signatura, Raphael painted an exceptional scene now known as The School of Athens. Under statues of Apollo and Athena, ancient philosophers and scientists are gathered. At the centre are the two giants of Athens, Plato and Aristotle. On the left, the aged Plato is pointing upwards to the world of forms. On the right and slightly ahead of him, a younger Aristotle holds his hand in front of himself, horizontally, to show that the real, material world holds the answers.

dynamic culture of Renaissance Italy was a result of the economic development and social mobility of the period. Rapid growth and ideals of meritocracy were upsetting traditional hierarchies. The aristocracy of blood was to some extent replaced by an aristocracy of wealth. Successful Florentine merchants and even shopkeepers were ennobled, and the old nobility was not ashamed of engaging in lucrative commerce. They often entered into family relationships with the rich bourgeoisie. In such a dynamic economy, people had to claim their status in a new way, and many used the language of art, architecture and literature to ascend the social hierarchy. Guilds, fraternities and individuals started commissioning works of art on a large scale. ‘Culture became, in part, a form of competitive, common, and conspicuous consumption.’53 For some, patronage functioned as a letter of indulgence. Especially for those who acquired wealth in a questionable way, large donations to charity, churches and art was a way to redeem themselves.

Italian art was a branch of commerce, often a collaborative effort in workshops, with masters, assistants and apprentices cooperating on paintings, cross-fertilizing styles and techniques. By 1478, Florence had forty painters’ shops and fifty-four sculptors’ shops. Painters belonged to the guild of physicians and pharmacists because they dealt with chemicals, while most sculptors belonged to the guild of goldsmiths. Artworks were commissioned, and the motive, materials and colours were strictly defined in contracts. If an artist was inspired to add a few small angels that weren’t in the contract, he was quickly ordered to turn them into puffy clouds.

Donatello finished his statue of David, slayer of Goliath. It was the first free-standing bronze statue since antiquity, as well as the first nude. It had been commissioned by Cosimo Medici, who cleverly hid his own ambitions to manipulate the city’s politics by adding text stating that it represented the city’s resistance against tyranny. David would be a potent symbol for the city’s liberties, sometimes even against the Medici. In 1504, an even more awe-inspiring David was unveiled by Michelangelo (1475–1564), who was not yet thirty. More than 5 metres tall, the heroic, muscular nude was carved from a single colossal block of marble. According to his own famous description, Michelangelo had merely liberated a figure that he had already seen existing in the stone. His next major project was to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. For four years, Michelangelo lay on his back, with paint dripping on his face, painting more than 500 square metres of ceiling. The result was some of the most iconic versions we have of the biblical story, including the scene where God reaches out with his right arm to impart the spark of life into the first man, Adam. This might not even be Michelangelo’s most visible work. By the end of his life, he worked as chief architect of the St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, and he was the principal designer of much of the building we see there today.

The only artist who can compete with Michelangelo for fame was his older rival, the painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, musician and scientist Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), the very symbol of the Renaissance Man, the universal genius. Michelangelo mocked Leonardo for not finishing most of his works, whereas Leonardo thought that Michelangelo’s overly muscular figures looked more like sacks of walnuts than real humans.

Leonardo, the illegitimate son of a Florentine notary and an orphan, was the master of observation. He studied nature, life, materials and constructions and filled his notebooks with cascades of observations and drawings. He dissected humans and animals to understand every single detail perfectly: the bones, veins, muscles and organs. He described how to draw a foot in ten different ways, each of which reveals the structure in a unique way. By studying light and vision, and the nature of painting materials, Leonardo invented techniques to create depth and mimic how some things are in focus and out of focus to the human mind. The result was some of the greatest paintings of all time, like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. ‘He knew how to perspective the fuck out of things’, as the Netflix series Cunk on Earth recently referred to the latter painting: ‘You almost feel like you can crawl inside it and betray Jesus yourself.’ Leonardo did not go to all this trouble just to paint more realistically than Michelangelo and everybody else, but also to satisfy his own curiosity. Leonardo was, in Kenneth Clark’s words, ‘The most relentlessly curious man in history. Everything he saw made him ask why and how’, echoing the question in Athenian drama: ‘Why is this so? What do we mean by that?’56 Leonardo was obsessed with every problem he came across: how birds fly, how sound travels, how rivers flow, why we find petrified seashells on mountains, how friction affects machines, how light radiates from mirrors, how they build locks in Flanders. He tried to find out, wrote it down, made drawings and constantly asked new questions about it. And he famously came up with designs for helicopters, flying machines, armoured vehicles, scuba gear, parachutes, a giant crossbow, a robotic knight and many, many things besides. It is exhausting just to look at his notebooks. This obsessive curiosity also meant that Michelangelo was correct: Leonardo started many more projects than he completed. He often got bored once he knew how to solve a problem, and rather than finishing a painting or design, he was distracted by a new fascinating problem and moved on. But this also makes him an excellent representative of the Renaissance. This was not an era of fixed answers and closed systems, but of curiosity and questions.

In Florence in the 1580s, a group of musicians and a poet came up with the idea that drama could be sung in a impassioned manner, and so opera was born. Not much later, in Spain and England, respectively, Cervantes (1547–1616) and Shakespeare (1564–1616) invented the novel and the modern drama. They abandoned the didactic storytelling of both the Church and the humanists for an exploration of the human psyche. Here we have characters who are alive, who think, doubt and change, and not necessarily for the sake of salvation. Perhaps this is the moment that we can talk about the birth of man for real. It took a while.

When the French scholar Loys Le Roy looked back at the previous 200 years from the year 1575, he argued that this era had recovered learning, art and sciences so that ‘this our age can be compared to the most learned times that ever were’. But he also made the case that three innovations that we had previously seen in China now ushered in a completely new episode in European history: the printing press, the compass and gunpowder.

In the 1440s, the German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg managed to combine heavy presses for crushing olives and grapes, the oil-based ink of painters, his own skills in carving punches for coins, and a little bit of inspiration from Asia, to create the first European movable-type printing press. Thanks to this, wrote Le Roy, ‘more work is accomplished in one day than many diligent scribes could do in a year’. It also made books affordable. Some scholars, such as Antonio Beccadelli, had sold a farm to afford to buy a copy of Livy’s history of Rome, but it was printing that made books accessible for the middle classes. In the last half of the fifteenth century, more books were printed than the total number of hand-copied books since the fall of Rome. Printing would not have been possible had it not been for the arrival of paper. At first paper was imported from Arabs, but by the thirteenth century there was a domestic Italian paper industry. At this time, paper was not made from trees, but from old rags. For all the wrong reasons, after the disastrous plague, Europe had an excess supply of those. When printed books started appearing in Italy in the early 1470s, many feared them. ‘Now the most stupid ideas can, in a moment, be transferred into a thousand volumes and spread abroad’, warned the Medici’s librarian.63 Many complained that it would make scribes unemployed, but in fact the mass of books now printed often left space for illustrations and illuminated capitals, so scribes and illuminators still had a lot of work.

Aldus Martinus decided to use the invention of the printing press to save classical wisdom from ever being lost again. His print shop in Venice, by now the capital of printing, published rare manuscripts in large editions. He also invented the forerunner to both the paperback and italic type. Between 1495 and 1498, he printed Aristotle’s five-volume collected works in Greek: 1,000 copies, perhaps as many as had ever been copied by hand. New standardized editions of classics, with the same pagination, revolutionized not just accessibility but also the ability to research, communicate and criticize.

the marine compass. Thanks to this, whole oceans could be navigated and ‘a great part of terra firma discovered in the West and the South, unknown to the ancients, and therefore called “the new world”’. Here again, Europe’s fragmentation of power made it possible to seek alternative patrons. The great Chinese maritime adventures were terminated because the emperor changed his mind about ocean travel. In Europe, the Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus also faced problems setting out to sea. He was turned down by various rulers when he put forward proposals to search for a westward route to Asia. The Portuguese, English and French kings all declined his request to fund the expedition, as did the dukes of Medina-Sidonia and Medinaceli. Columbus spent twenty years trying to get a sponsor, but that is how Western Europe was different from China – he could keep looking for alternatives. And, eventually, the Spanish court said yes, and in 1492 his expedition accidentally discovered America.

the Portuguese sailor Bartolomeu Dias had managed to navigate around the southern tip of Africa, proving that it was possible to reach the Indian Ocean. In 1497, Vasco da Gama would take the same route and make it all the way to India. In just a few years, a new continent to the west and another route to Asia had been discovered. Both had the effect of reducing the Middle East’s central position in world trade and, by extension, some of the importance and wealth of the Italian trading powers. It also shook an intellectual world that had treated the Bible and ancient thinkers as authorities. Suddenly there was a whole new continent that God had forgotten to tell us about. Ptolemy had been wrong in thinking that it was not possible to sail south of Africa to the Indian Ocean. Pliny’s Natural History had not covered any of the strange creatures now discovered. And no one had ever seen potatoes, tomatoes, pineapple, cocoa, chocolate, maize, cassava or tobacco before.

In Spain, a group of thinkers influenced by Thomas Aquinas, now known as the School of Salamanca after the university there, developed advanced proto-liberal ideas about individual rights, economic freedom and rule of law. Controversially, some of them argued that the king was only hired by people to protect their rights, and if he abused these rights, they were entitled to depose him. ‘If for our welfare, we need someone to govern us, we are the ones who must grant him the power, rather than him imposing it upon us with his sword,’ wrote Juan de Mariana.68 When adapting these ideas to the Americas, these scholars argued that Indians could not be seen as brute animals and natural slaves, because they had reason and organized societies. The founder of the Salamanca tradition, the Dominican thinker Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546) declared gutsily that ‘the emperor is not master of the whole world’. Instead, the natives ‘undoubtedly possessed as true dominion, both public and private, as any Christian. That is to say, they could not be robbed of their property either as private citizens or as princes.’69 Therefore, it was a crime to enslave Indians, steal their property or land, or force them to convert. The capture of Aztec and Inca treasures was simple robbery and these valuables should be returned to their rightful owners.

Having surrendered territory to the French invader, the Medici family lost support and were driven out of Florence. During this chaotic time, the ruling council empowered the charismatic Dominican friar Savonarola in 1495. During his three-year rule, he turned Florence into a radical theocracy. Preaching the need for moral purification, like so many others in times of crisis, Savonarola organized bands of young men into a morality police. They patrolled the streets in search of sodomites, adulterers and drunkards and they entered buildings to seize secular texts and art, musical instruments, tapestries and elegant dresses. At a huge ‘bonfire of the vanities’, topped by the figure of Satan, he burned these symbols of wealth, luxury and paganism in the main square in 1497 and again in 1498. But he overreached. After preaching against the pope, Savonarola was condemned for heresy by the Church and hanged in the same main square. At the time, Savonarola seemed like a bizarre fanatic. People were blissfully unaware that he was a portent of things to come. Florence returned to a more secular form of republicanism for a while, but the Medici family plotted their comeback. They made a deal with the Spanish, who sacked the city in 1512 and returned the family to power. In 1527, however, the Florentines drove out the Medici again and established a new Florentine Republic. It was to be the last. A large imperial and Spanish army, allied with the Medici pope Clement VII, besieged the city for almost ten months. After the death of perhaps 30,000 Florentines, the city surrendered. This time, the conquerors took no chances with the unruly republicans. The government, elected by the guilds, was dissolved and Alessandro de Medici was made hereditary duke by the Holy Roman emperor. For 200 years, the Medici would rule Florence as unelected monarchs.

intellectual control and clerical discipline, and the powers of the Inquisition grew. Papal Rome was now no longer a separate realm, but subservient to Spain, the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg forces, which between 1519 and 1556 happened to be controlled by just one man. History’s greatest multi-tasker, Charles V (1500–1558), was head of the House of Habsburg, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor.

The growing interest in the critical study of texts (and of how the Church lived up to them) and the printing press combined to turn Martin Luther’s 1517 protest against the pope into a continent-wide Reformation movement. Erasmus, whose long-standing calls for reform of the Church had inspired Luther, blamed him for ‘the irremediable confusion of everything’.74 This is the kind of rift within a religion that often sparks panic, since heretics are usually seen as worse than heathens. Both Catholics and Protestants even expressed the idea that their Christian rivals were more wicked than the Muslim Ottomans. The Catholic Church reacted to this existential challenge to its authority in much the same way as the Sunni Abbasids reacted to divisions within Islam, by trying to renew what they saw as a more pure, original doctrine. With military force and inquisitions, they enforced a religious orthodoxy and quashed the unruly debates and independent thinking that we associate with the Renaissance.

In 1559, an Index of Prohibited Books was drawn up indicating literature that Catholics were banned from printing or reading, including many enjoyed by and sometimes even published by previous popes. The list of banned books would be expanded and regularly updated until 1966. Eventually it read like a who’s who of the greatest European writers, with entries like Grotius, Montaigne, Spinoza, Bacon, Locke, Montesquieu and Voltaire. By 1600, most of the works of the Renaissance humanists were out of print, and some of its authors were in prison. Almost three-quarters of all books printed in Europe were now banned.

Erasmus had been declared the leader of all heretics, and his books were burned. The archbishop of Toledo was forced to spend almost eighteen years in a dungeon for having leaned towards the opinions of Erasmus. Merely possessing a book listed in the Index was punishable by death in Spain. In France, informers who exposed someone who owned or promulgated Protestant literature received a third of the condemned heretic’s estate.

continent that was previously separated between Church and state was now becoming divided between rival Church–state alliances that clamped down on freedom within their domains. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, were forcibly relocated because of their beliefs. As so often in European history, Jews suffered disproportionately from a growing climate of intolerance. After Ferdinand and Isabella united Spain in 1492, they forced the Jews to leave the country. Anti-semitism was always a part of Christian tradition and most of the humanists shared it at least to some extent. Now it took an uglier turn. In pamphlets and sermons in the 1540s, Luther sanctioned violence against Jews and tried to get them expelled. Just a few years later, popes enacted anti-Jewish legislation and ordered the burning of Talmud books throughout Italy.

The Catholic Church felt it had to step up its persecution game, not to lose out in the competition between fanaticisms. In 1616, when Copernicus was long dead and his book on heliocentrism had been in print for more than seventy years, the Catholic Church suddenly found it heretical and burned it. The great polymath Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was warned not to hold such a position or to uncover such evidence with his improved telescopes. He could of course not help himself, and in 1633 he was dragged in front of the Inquisition and threatened with torture. After recanting, he was sentenced to house arrest for life, and publication of his books was banned, including books not yet written. Five years later, the English poet John Milton visited Galileo in his villa outside Florence, and deplored that the repression against him and others had strangled inquiry and ‘dampened the glory of Italian wits’.

Europe took a long, hard look at the alternatives of toleration and religious war, and decided to take its chances with ruin and misery everywhere. For more than a century, the continent stumbled from one inquisition and massacre to the next. Both Catholics and Protestants started finding witches everywhere, troubled by lingering customs and beliefs where they tried to impose strict orthodoxies. Thousands of women were tortured until they confessed consorting with the devil, so that they could be properly burned. The wars of fanaticism culminated in the Thirty Years’ War 1618–1648, which devastated Germany and killed perhaps as many as a third of the population. No one was more mercilessly downcast by Europe’s sudden lapse into insanity than that pre-eminent proponent of toleration and cosmopolitanism, Erasmus. In 1517, the peace-loving Christian had written ‘I congratulate this our age – which bids fair to be an age of gold’. By 1536, fenced in by terror and torture on all sides, he began to fear that he was instead living in ‘the worst age of history’.

The Italian Renaissance is remembered as the rebirth of Europe after a long era of stagnation during the early Middle Ages. From innovative art and new finance and business models to the journeys of discovery, here we find many of the factors that would set Europe on a new trajectory towards the modern era. This was made possible by typical golden-age conditions. There was an increased openness to the rest of the world, led by the north Italian trade centres who thought that trade should be free, even into the gates of Hell. European merchants and adventurers were stupefied to find advanced goods, technologies, scientific knowledge, financial institutions and Arabic numerals on their journeys to the Byzantines, the Middle East and Asia. Islamic learning helped Europeans to reconnect with a Greek and Roman world that had been lost for almost a millennium, especially a more worldly philosophy that stimulated an interest in nature, science and economics.

looked less like the Roman, Abbasid and Chinese empires, and more like the classical Greek abundance of competing city-states, always fighting but also constantly learning and trading. This was incredibly important because radical ideas and innovations had by now been repressed in China, Byzantium and the Islamic world, where new rulers had simply changed their mind. In a more fragmented Europe, new ideas could always survive somewhere, and innovators could always find refuge elsewhere.

Relationships between individuals, groups and states were also increasingly guided by rule of law, as a result of the rediscovery and re-interpretation of Roman Law. Just as the Abbasids had found they needed educated scholars to run a large imperial administration, cities and a new worldly Church discovered that they needed scholars to handle bureaucracy, debate law and taunt rivals, thereby stimulating literacy and social mobility. Characteristically, economic freedom during the Renaissance was brought about not by a political initiative, but because rebellious cities and serfs fought to engage in it. When markets began to break down feudalism, new careers and opportunities emerged. Social mobility in rapidly growing cities and the glass mirror contributed to the familiar golden-age phenomena of curiosity, self-examination and individualism, reflected in literature and a flourishing of painting and sculpture.

In the early 1500s, the new iron cannonballs levelled city walls and made it possible for despots to suppress the independent-minded. Destructive wars began to tear down the peaceful exchange of ideas and books. People who used to venture out for adventure and profit started to hide for safety. Even more fateful was the Catholic panic over the Reformation. In a close parallel to how the Sunni Abbasids had reacted when challenged by other interpretations of the Islamic faith, the Church decided to shut down open debates and the humanist school that it had previously sponsored. The old, constructive division between Church and state was replaced by mutually hostile state–Church alliances and their competing fanaticisms. As John Milton had lamented, repression and religious wars ‘dampened the glory of Italian wits’. Instead of inquiry, we got Inquisitions. Charles V, head of the House of Habsburg, king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, even started pursuing a dream of unifying Europe under one man, one army and one orthodoxy. For a time, it looked like the continent would have gone the way of the stagnant empires, terminating the diversity and fragmentation that set it apart. If it weren’t for the Dutch, he might very well have succeeded.

ISIS are not the only Jihadists that have taken a special liking to the black flag. They are in the company of the Afghani Taliban and several chapters of Al Qaeda, among others. There are accounts that Muhammad used black as a signalling colour on the battlefield, but the black flag was not used by the early Caliphate, it is not promoted in the Quran and black is not a holy colour in Islam. But the fundamentalist terrorists are right that there was a golden era of Islam when the world looked towards it with admiration and envy, when the caliphs, the supreme leaders of a Muslim state, ruled under the black flag, because it was the symbol of the governing dynasty from the late eighth century, the Abbasid family.

This was the age when Muslim rulers did not torture and kill dissenters and infidels, but learned from them and exchanged ideas, insights and goods with them. This was the moment when Arab culture built on the achievement of other cultures to unleash a creative era of science and philosophy that would go on to inspire medieval Christianity and the Renaissance.

Imagine that, out of the blue, tiny Iceland took advantage of Europe’s weakness after the Second World War, and in short succession conquered Britain, France and Germany and established a vast empire. This is the comparison the Scottish historian William Dalrymple uses to make us understand how unexpected and shocking the Arab conquest was.7 The Muslim calendar begins in 622, when the founder of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad (570–632), migrated to Medina (in today’s western Saudi Arabia) to escape persecution in Mecca. Just thirty years later, Muslim Arabs had brought the world’s two exhausted superpowers, the Byzantines and the Persian Sasanians, to their knees. Persia and the Levant, the richest and most important parts of the Eastern Roman Empire, were absorbed into what would become a huge Muslim empire, stretching from Algeria to Afghanistan. It seemed like the Arabs came out of nowhere to create one of the biggest, richest and most intellectually dynamic empires.

In just a few decades, the Arabs had become the inheritors of several of the world’s oldest and most impressive cultures, Rome, Syria–Palestine, Egypt, Babylon and Persia, and stretching into Central Asia and bordering India. Their new empire was populated by a sprawling array of different ethnic and religious groups. There were Muslims, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians, and they spoke Arabic, Persian, Aramaic and Greek. Importantly, the Euphrates river, the ancient border between the East and West, was now open for trade and travel (the new fiercely contested border between empires was in the Mediterranean, ruining old cities like Alexandria). It resulted in an explosion of intellectual and economic innovation. Agriculture benefited quickly, as landowners imported new crops from India and Africa and adapted new methods including sophisticated irrigation systems. Landowners and peasants profited, and the diet of people improved.

The Umayyad dynasty, which took over the Caliphate after the death of Muhammad in 632, tried to centralize control to Damascus. Many groups used to self-governance felt that a small group of Arabs were trying to monopolize power and resources. This brewing discontent was exploited by a rebel movement that talked about Islam as a universalist creed with equality for all groups and ethnicities that embraced the new religion.

These groups turned to another family that could symbolize the return to a pure faith, since they were the descendants of Muhammad’s uncle, Abbas (566–653). Their agents were particularly successful in the Persian region of Khorasan, an area now divided between Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Here the Caliphate seemed both too distant – Damascus was a twenty-day ride to the west – and too intrusive. Arab settlers and converted locals resented high-handed and corrupt Umayyad governors who taxed them harshly. It was here in the summer of 747 that a mysterious commander calling himself Abu Muslim (father of Muslim) raised the black flag of the Abbasids for the first time. He was probably a Persian and might have been a former slave. He was by all accounts a talented and brutal general. His local troops, hardened by many years of frontier battles, drove the Umayyads out, and then went on the offensive. After an impressive series of victories, Abu Muslim’s men met the much larger Umayyad army for a decisive battle on the river Zab in northern Iraq in February 750. The Abbasids knelt and pointed their lances towards the enemy. The overconfident Umayyad cavalry charged against them, but the shield wall held and the attackers were destroyed. It caused panic among the Umayyads and their army disintegrated. Retreating soldiers were cut down by pursuers, and others drowned in the river. The last Umayyad caliph fled all the way to Egypt before he was found and killed. In another part of Iraq, the city of Kufa, rebels organized a coup. The new caliph, who took the name al-Saffah (721–754), appeared from a safe house, and natives and soldiers swore their allegiance. So began the Abbasid Caliphate.

We do know that at least one Umayyad prince got away, the 19-year-old Abd al-Rahman. He dodged the regime’s assassins and escaped through North Africa to Muslim Spain, Al-Andalus, where he set up an independent state that would last for three centuries. It was not only enemies and rebels that were executed. Whenever the loyalty of allies was doubted, they met a quick and bloody end. The second caliph, al-Mansur (714–775), who would rule for twenty-one years, even decided to kill the hero of the revolution, Abu Muslim. He feared his power and popularity in Khorasan, had his throat cut and bribed his commanders to stay calm.

Like Augustus in Rome, he was not just a brutal executioner but also an impressive statesman. He moved the capital of the Caliphate to a newly built city in Mesopotamia, closer to the heartland of Abbasid power. He called it Madinat as-Salam, the City of Peace, since he intended to create his own Pax Islamica. The city would become famous under the name of the original settlement, Baghdad. The centre of the city had a circular layout, which might have been an attempt to emulate a perfect circle in honour of the geometric teachings of Euclid, whom Mansur admired. It would become the biggest city on the planet, with lavish palaces, magnificent mosques and vibrant bazaars as well as bookstores, schools and hospitals. The markets were crowded with people, and the river filled with gondolas. According to some estimates, a million people populated the Abbasid capital at that time. It was a wonder of the world, but nothing is left of it today. Unlike Athens and Rome, Baghdad did not have major stone quarries, so sun-dried mud bricks were mostly used for construction, which left the city vulnerable to the wear and tear of time, nature, fire and invasions.

Baghdad was an extremely cosmopolitan city, described by the geographer Yaqubi as ‘the crossroads of the universe’. Immigrants came from the whole empire, first to build the city, then to benefit from its location and thriving economy. Here were Arabs and Persians, but also Armenians, Turks, Kurds and Indians. Muslims lived alongside Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians. Just as Rome had once been, Baghdad became even more international by the many slaves who were bought or kidnapped from India, Africa, Eastern Europe or the Iberian Peninsula, many of whom were later set free by the owners and became integrated.

This was the world of One Thousand and One Nights, a place of mystery and wonder, where adventure and hazard could wait around every corner. The Arabian Nights, as it is often called, is a collection of Middle Eastern folktales, many set in Baghdad. Sometimes they feature the caliph al-Rashid (763/766–809), Mansur’s grandson, when he wanders the streets at night in the company of his friend and advisor Jafar al-Barmaki, of the influential Barmakid family, the important sponsors of science and translations. A fascinating aspect of these tales is how often the hero is a merchant involved in a daring adventure in order to acquire wealth. In Western fiction the protagonist often fights for honour, justice or the princess and half the kingdom, but rarely for economic gain. However, as Nima Sanandaji writes, ‘Many Iranian, Arab and Kurdish folktales feature characters that enrich themselves and benefit society by working hard, trading and investing.’16 The independent story of Sinbad the Sailor, which was added to One Thousand and One Nights at a late stage, is one example. It tells the story of seven magical voyages of a Baghdad merchant who defies shipwrecks, monsters and cannibals to do business and restore the family fortune. It’s a typical tale from the crossroads. Baghdad, a city on the river Tigris and close to the Euphrates, had many benefits over landlocked Damascus. The caliph said that the city was built here to make sure that trade flowed smoothly and prices stayed low. Grain could come from the north, dates and rice from the south, and luxury goods from the Far East. ‘This is the Tigris; there is no obstacle between us and China: everything on the sea can come to us on it.’

17 The new empire was a vast free-trade area, governed by a system of beliefs and rules understood by all: just like in Rome, a citizen could expect the same treatment and rights wherever he travelled. The principles of free trade were also extended to cover external trade, so the same taxes applied to both. Islamic coins from this era have been found in central Europe, England, Scandinavia and even Iceland. But of most interest were the richer parts of the world, Central Asia, India and China. Exceptionally, the three important routes to Asia – the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Silk Route – were now under control of the same empire, and this enabled an integrated logistical system under a Pax Islamica. A triangular lateen sail adopted from the North African Christian Copts helped to connect the waterways, allowing vessels to tack into the wind. It was as close to a global market that humanity had hitherto achieved. In his history of world trade, William Bernstein writes: Within a few centuries of the Prophet’s death, his followers had knitted almost the entirety of the known world into a vast emporium in which African gold, ivory, and ostrich feathers could be exchanged for Scandinavian furs, Baltic amber, Chinese silks, Indian pepper, and Persian metal crafts.18 A Chinese visitor couldn’t believe his eyes: ‘everything produced from the earth is there. Carts carry countless goods to markets, where everything is available and cheap.’19 It resembled trade under the Pax Romana, with the difference that the Muslim common market was much bigger, and private capital and individual adventurers played a larger role than in Rome.

Just as in Athens and Rome, the foundation for all of this trade was a market-based system back home, with a high degree of freedom for people to make their own economic decisions. Land was mostly the property of individuals, who had the right to sell, mortgage, will, cultivate or rent it. In The Encyclopaedia of Islamic Economics, the system is summarized: ‘The Abbasid economic system was generally a market and profit oriented economy largely based upon private property, private initiative and free market exchange.’20 Prices were free to move according to changes in supply and demand, helping to steer trade and investments to the areas where it was most in demand. This was an important aspect, an implication based on the story that Muhammad had opposed calls to impose price controls when food prices spiked. Regulation of prices was a traditional and popular policy, but Muhammad rejected it, saying that ‘Allah is the one who fixes prices.’21 Even though Athens and Rome were also market-based economies, they mostly still saw commerce as a necessary evil, best left to slaves, freed men and foreigners. Even thinkers with a sophisticated understanding of the value of exchange found it degrading. Aristotle thought that trade for profit was vulgar, and Cicero found it embarrassing for a gentleman to sell his labour. And Jesus said that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. Islamic culture was different. Alone among the world religions, Islam was founded by a merchant. In one hadith (the collection of sayings and actions of the Prophet), Muhammad says that, ‘The truthful, trustworthy merchant is with the Prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs.’ The Quran is filled with the vocabulary of the marketplace and encourages ‘trade by mutual consent’. Islamic religious law busied itself with protecting merchants and their interests. Extensive trade and economic

Prosperity was not limited to the elite. Records of clothes taxes reveal that many people wore silk and cotton. In 892, there were over a hundred bookshops in Baghdad, which would not have been possible if only the privileged bought books.23 The wealth also filled the coffers of the caliphs, who used much of it on the military, palaces and harems, the isolated domestic space reserved for the women of the house, wives and enslaved concubines. But the caliphs also spent lavishly on science and libraries.

In Islam it was illegal to enslave fellow believers, so slaves were usually brought from far away, after conquests, kidnappings or purchases. Often Christians enslaved each other to sell to the booming Arab region (until the Christian Church imitated the Muslim ban); other slaves came from the trans-Saharan slave trade. It has been estimated that around 10 million slaves were brought to the Muslim world, perhaps more. However, unlike in many ancient states and the modern colonial system, the slave was granted certain legal rights and the owner had certain obligations. Slaves were a commodity, and could be bought, sold, sexually exploited or killed, but they were not seen as cattle or things.

‘The Muslim woman had property rights unparalleled in the modern West until comparatively recent times’, writes Bernard Lewis.24 Women were allowed to start businesses, sign contracts and did not have to give their pre-marriage property or earnings from work and business to their husbands. They also had inheritance rights, though not equal to men. And there is no stipulation in the Quran for women to wear a face-veil. However, when there is a subordination of women to men, even though less radical than elsewhere, and it has a theological sanction, it is much more difficult to change it. And so it is that the same property and inheritance rights that were at first the most progressive, can eventually appear as the most reactionary, relative to the changes in other places. One reason why the Caliphate did not continue to evolve was that its legal institutions could not adapt as easily. In his book The Long Divergence, the economist Timur Kuran documents that something similar can be said in the economic realm. The Islamic world had sophisticated economic institutions and contract laws. However, these did not change when the needs changed, for example to embrace changes in economic relations, so they blocked innovations in civil society and commercial enterprises. For example, economic partnerships ended with the death of a partner in order to protect inheritors, preventing the development of more complex forms of corporations such as those that would appear in the West.25

Persian rulers claimed that they could discern their right to rule in the stars, and when the Abbasids inherited such claims, they searched for knowledge about astrology. (This was a long-lasting obsession in many cultures – in the 1340s, scholars at the University of Paris explained the Black Death with a malign conjunction of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter.) One of its beneficial consequences was an interest in the related fields of astronomy and mathematics. A group of Indian scholars who understood the stars’ movement and could predict eclipses were invited to the caliph Mansur’s court in Baghdad. He ordered translations of the scientific texts in Sanskrit that they brought, which would jumpstart Arab study of astronomy and arithmetic.

The new bureaucracy also had to master many subjects to be able to administer the empire and Islamic law. The secretaries had to understand timekeeping, engineering for construction and irrigation, and mathematics for accounting and surveying. Algebra became an important tool to work out the complexities of inheritance laws. Every civilization has similar needs, of course, but in a new empire with nomadic traditions, there was little previous and tacit knowledge about such subjects. It had to be learned through formal procedures and the use of plenty of books. ‘We have all the words, but they have all the ideas’, as one translator said about the Persians.27 Eventually, the translation movement became self-perpetuating. The original commissions and funding came from the Abbasids, courtiers and officials, but in due course all economically and politically important groups, regardless of ethnicity and religion, became involved.

Abbasid troops defeated the Tang Chinese in Kazakhstan in 751, and, according to legend, they learned from Chinese war prisoners how to make a new material to write on, made from linen and hemp fibres – paper. It was both cheaper and more durable than the papyrus traditionally used, and much more so than the animal skins Europeans called parchment. Soon public and private libraries were filled with paper books. When an Islamic school was founded in Baghdad in 1234, it was said to have received an endowment of 80,000 books from the caliph’s personal library.

The idea that motivated the project was that knowledge had no borders. This was ground-breaking. There was no ‘Christian science’, ‘Muslim science’ or ‘Persian science’; there was only science itself, a search for observable facts and a rational methodology by which we discover causal links between them. And then it doesn’t matter where the person who did the observing came from or what the faith of the person who documented the link was.

The ninth-century mathematician al-Khwarizmi developed a set of rules to find solutions to linear and quadratic equations and ways of calculating areas and volumes. The title of his book, Al-Jabr (‘completion’), gave us the word algebra, and the Latin version of his name (Algoritmi) gave us ‘algorithm’. Helpfully, he also imported the Hindu numeral system with ten digits, including zero, which would later be imported by Europeans as ‘Arabic numerals’. Crucially, the Hindu–Arabic system is positional, where the value of a digit depends on its position. This makes all arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) easier than in the Roman system.

Astronomy and geography were always important obsessions. The caliphs did not just translate Ptolemy’s texts, they also ordered experiments and built observatories to find out if he was right. They understood the heavens better than others and created the most accurate maps yet. A map commissioned by an early ninth-century caliph surpassed the Ptolemaic perception of the Indian Ocean as an inland sea, and showed oceans around the continents, hinting at the possibility of circumnavigating Africa.

the early eleventh century, the polymath al-Biruni measured the circumference of the earth surprisingly correctly and it led him to assume the existence of a continent somewhere between Europe and Asia. He hypothesized that it was inhabited. Working with a team of scholars, the Persian astronomer Omar Khayyam managed to measure the length of the year as the remarkably accurate 365.2421986 days and devised a solar calendar that was more precise than the Gregorian calendar introduced in Europe 500 years later.

Mutazilism, a school that emphasized humanity’s free will and the power of reason. The Mutazilites believed that rationality was a tool to understand not just the world and the laws of nature, but even morality, religion and God. When reason and the Quran collided, the latter had to be re-interpreted, or understood in an allegorical way. The Mutazilites argued that this was possible since the Quran was created and not eternal, as other theologians claimed. This belief in human reason led some of the Mutazila scholars to go so far as to denounce kings and despots. They denied that political power was given by God and called for decentralization and sometimes democratization. A few of them, who have been called ‘Mu’tazila anarchists’, even thought that an Islamic society and Islamic law could function without any government. Patricia Crone summarizes their argument: ‘[I]f an imam were to turn into a king, by ceasing to govern in accordance with the law, then the Muslims would be legally obliged to fight him and depose him.’ ‘Since imams kept turning into kings, the best solution was not to set them up in the first place.’39 This opposition to authoritarianism makes Mutazilism a highly improbable candidate for a religious inquisition, but the fact that one happened showed that no idea is so good that it cannot be abused. In 827, the caliph al-Mamun turned a certain aspect of their doctrine into state orthodoxy: the createdness of the Quran. In 833, just a few months before his death, Mamun established a form of inquisition, which meant religious scholars could be punished for dissent, giving the lie to his earlier statements about free speech.

Mamun’s inquisition and Mutawakkil’s counter-repression revealed the weakness of a culture of openness and creativity dependent on enlightened despots. If one man changed his mind, everything could change.

It is very likely that sooner or later the tribes would want to kill the goose which lays the golden egg. Such is the nature of barbaric, lesser evolved tribes. Their primary resort is violence

As Aristotle's teachings came to be the precipitant for Florentine flourishment, Neo Confucianism served in a similar manner as the foundation of intellectual and spiritual enquiry in Song China.

It appears that some form of philosophical coherence is required for a golden age to really take hold. One could argue that international charter of human rights served as that in the post WW2 western world. But apparently its appeal was limited and it could not take hold globally which is understandable becuase different cultures have different needs. 
What could be the new philosophy which could emerge or some old philosopher's teaching which could accelerate the dawn of new golden age. Could neo-buddhism be that?

A reactionary mentality, which is often a knee-jerk reaction to an external threat almost always ends up in a civilisation turning away from the core principles of what made it so propserous in the first place. It has happened in Athens, in Rome, in Baghdad, in Song China and it appears to have begun in the post WW2 west

Modern day parallels with how NATO and post-bretton woods financial order is being deployed by United States to further their own agenda of economic and political domination.

The first step is to demonise a common seemingly far-away enemy and use the fear to get everyone to contribute to a common security mechanism and slowly take control of such a military apparatus to punish those who veer out of line

Athenians had themselves to blame. But such is the ravenous nature of power that once you have tasted a certain level of prosperity, any depreciation in that comes to be seen as an exigent event and answers begin to be searched externally. It does not occur to look at updating the political and economic structures fit for the contemporary world which reflect the changing reality. This harking back to a goneby era leads premier powers to turn against each other instead of cooperating in a manner acceptable to all. A natural consequence is breakdown in old alliances and the premier power ends up standing alone and eventually fades away. But there is always a final fight where the diminishing power makes its stand abd eventually weakens itself. No empire has stood the assault of time and any attempts to interfere with the natural progression of power only appears to accelerate its flight

In a war like situation it can be disastrous to expect the enemy to act rationally. War is a big gamble and it is easy to start. It is more difficult to control overreach and predict the unintended or unforeseen consequences. In this case plague and disease weakened the physical and mental strength of Athenians to wage war

The roman ability to raise troops to fight back draws from their unique system of drafting fighters from newly conquered territories. It was a war machine. They gave the newly won territories a share of new wealth and thus were able to last longer than simple plunder and tax regimes. There was an active interest in ensuring the continuity of business as usual

Spanish folly to close their ports to Dutch vessels forced them to look further and into East Indies. Their global aspirations came alive and struggle with Portuguese to take control of key trading ports in Asia ensued. An important invention was joint stock holding Dutch East India company which could raise capital from private ordinary investors. This gave a large pool of funds and distributed risk and profits. No one had more ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope than the Dutch in the 17th century

As one internet meme put it, when American men hit the age of thirty-five they have a choice to make: they can become obsessed with either their civil war, the Second World War or barbecuing. The British tend to be less interested in their own civil wars but many of their bookshelves, especially those of men, groan under the weight of books on the conflict. Histories of campaigns and daring special operations feature heavily, although so too do biographies of the wartime leaders and generals such as Churchill and Montgomery.

and almost a quarter of a million employees. Franks was no great theorist and lacked a background in economics but he was both a brilliant administrator and a master of fine detail. His real skill, though, prefacing his later time in Washington, was as a diplomat and a broker.

He was fundamentally a problem solver who looked to put the right organisation in place and ensure that the right people were in key roles. He is widely credited with playing a crucial role both in rebuilding the British Army, at breakneck pace, after the disaster of Dunkirk in which much of their heavy equipment had been lost, and in managing the fallout from German U-boat attacks when it seemed for a time that merchant shipping losses could derail Britain’s war effort. These sorts of jobs – managing and planning production, ensuring that soldiers were equipped and the civilian population kept fed, allocating finite resources between direct war-fighting capacity and the needs of the production industries – were critical to the wars of the twentieth century. In the long run, getting them right mattered more to the outcome of the war than what actually happened on the battlefield.

The First and Second World Wars saw a new type of warfare: total war. Not only entire militaries but entire societies and economic structures were rerouted towards military ends. When it comes to the share of total output devoted to the war effort, the numbers are without precedent. Take Britain, a country with a long history of global conflict before 1914, as an example. During the early 1700s, when the Duke of Marlborough was leading the allied force in the Low Countries, British spending generally amounted to around 4 to 8 per cent of national income. The Seven Years’ War saw that figure rise to over 10 to 12 per cent in the early 1760s. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars required around the same level of effort, with around 10 to 12 per cent of national output being pushed towards the Royal Navy and the British Army, and being spent as subsidies to allies in the 1790s and early 1800s to mid-1810s. By 1916, Britain was devoting 41 per cent of all national output towards the war, and in 1917 and 1918 almost 50 per cent. The story of the Second World War is remarkably similar; about 50 per cent of GDP, and actually more than 50 per cent in 1945, was the norm. One in every two pounds produced by the British went on fighting. And while Britain was spending a higher share of its national output on warfare than the United States in the Second World War, which peaked at a ‘mere’ 45 per cent, it was – proportionately – spending less than some other great powers. The military burden hit more than 60 per cent of GDP in the Soviet Union and more than 70 per cent in Germany by 1943. These are, by any stretch, colossal numbers. One advantage enjoyed by Franks and his contemporaries in the Second World War was the fact that the generation before them – and sometimes the very same people – had already done this. Indeed, Franks’ first action on being appointed director of raw materials – as a good, well-trained academic – was to read the official six-volume history of the Ministry of Munitions during the Great War. The leaders who found themselves managing the Great War of 1914 had no such reservoir of experience to draw on. Most thought the war would be over relatively quickly. The last few years of the American Civil War, especially in northern Virginia, and the even more recent experience of the Russo-Japanese War, a decade before the First World War, had, it is true, demonstrated that entrenched infantry could be very tough for an attacker to shift. But the experience of wars between European powers over the previous seventy or so years was taken to be a better pointer to how the war that began in 1914 would play out. In the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1 the fighting had generally lasted from a few weeks to a few months at most.

What many failed to grasp was how quickly military technology had shifted in the final couple of decades before 1914 and the advantages that handed to the defender. The British Army Staff College course of the 1890s, for example, which was attended by most of the colonels who would go on to command as generals in the First World War, was reasonably up to date in its understanding of modern warfare. The students studied the American Civil War of 1861–5, the Franco-Prussian War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8. They learned how breech-loading rifles (where the infantry soldier was able to load his rifle without having to push the bullet all the way down the barrel as in an older muzzle loader) had increased the firepower of infantry and how rifled artillery and high-explosive shells had increased the power of that
